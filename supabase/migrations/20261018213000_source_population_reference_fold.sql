-- A source's size is evidence in public.source_census, each row with its method, confidence and clock. Two kinds:
--   * an exact census: a count read from the source itself (enumerated, search_index, sitemap, bounded, api_count, ...);
--   * a labelled reference: a figure someone supplied or a catalogue estimated (owner_reference, catalogue_estimate, and
--     the 2026-01-28 'estimate' rows). It is shown as an estimate with its method and as-of time, never as a count.
-- record_market_source_day() folds each source as of the day: the newest exact census, if it covers the lots held;
-- else the newest labelled reference that covers them; else unknown (NULL). A model of our own capture (capture_model,
-- turnover_model, window_extrapolated) is never a source's total: data-machine.md, fleet-relative reporting, forbids a
-- manufactured denominator. market_sources_read() grades a reference once a later exact census lands for its source
-- (population_grade: the reference, the census, and the reference's signed error against it).
