-- Revert of 20261113130000_image_stage_reconciler_first_pass.sql: switches the reconciler off and names nobody.
-- Receipts and closed work stay (they are the record of what was read). Open items stay queued and are not handed out:
-- the reader leaves the queue as soon as the switch is off. The classifier contract goes back to the seeded 'v98',
-- scan_per_lane to 1000 and claim_image_stage_work to the body 20261113110000 defined.
