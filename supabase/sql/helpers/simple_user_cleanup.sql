-- Simple cleanup of test users without breaking the working authentication system
-- This preserves all table structures, triggers, and policies

-- Just delete the test data, not the infrastructure

-- 1. Delete test profiles (this will help identify which users to remove)
DELETE FROM public.profiles 
WHERE email LIKE '%test%' 
   OR email LIKE '%trace%' 
   OR email LIKE '%example.com'
   OR email IS NULL;

-- 2. Delete corresponding auth users (only the test ones)
-- Note: You may need to run this part manually if you want to keep some real users
DELETE FROM auth.users 
WHERE email LIKE '%test%' 
   OR email LIKE '%trace%' 
   OR email LIKE '%example.com';

-- 3. Verify cleanup
SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining_profiles FROM public.profiles;
SELECT id, email, created_at FROM public.profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 4. Test that the system still works
