-- Delete all auth.users and dependent data
-- This handles all foreign key dependencies properly

-- ===================================================================
-- STEP 1: DELETE ALL DEPENDENT DATA FIRST
-- ===================================================================

-- Delete from tables that reference profiles or users
DELETE FROM public.engagement_metrics;
DELETE FROM public.vehicles;
DELETE FROM public.timeline_events;
DELETE FROM public.vehicle_images;
DELETE FROM public.skynalysis_analyses;
DELETE FROM public.ai_processors WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Delete all profiles (this references auth.users)
DELETE FROM public.profiles;

-- ===================================================================
-- STEP 2: DELETE ALL AUTH USERS
-- ===================================================================

-- This should now work without foreign key violations
DELETE FROM auth.users;

-- ===================================================================
-- STEP 3: VERIFICATION
-- ===================================================================

-- Check that everything is clean
