## Executive Summary

The Nuke platform creates permanent digital identities for vehicles throughout their entire lifecycle, connecting owners, professionals, and enthusiasts in a community centered around vehicle history, authenticity, and value creation. Unlike transaction-focused platforms, Nuke treats vehicles as first-class digital entities with persistent identities that accumulate information over time, regardless of ownership changes.

---

## Project Vision

Nuke transforms the traditional concept of vehicle ownership into a collaborative stewardship model that benefits the entire automotive ecosystem. By creating comprehensive, verifiable vehicle histories that persist beyond ownership changes, Nuke establishes a trusted record that enhances vehicle value, simplifies maintenance documentation, and creates new opportunities for community engagement and fractional investment.

## Core Architecture

### Vehicle-Centric Architecture

The foundational concept of Nuke is treating vehicles as persistent digital entities:

1. **Vehicle as Primary Entity**
   - Vehicles maintain comprehensive digital profiles regardless of ownership changes
   - All platform elements organize around the vehicle as the primary unit of value
   - Information accumulates over time, building complete vehicle histories

2. **Digital Identity Components**
   - Timeline-based event aggregation for complete vehicle history
   - Immutable record-keeping through blockchain verification
   - Multi-source data aggregation with confidence scoring
   - Ownership tracking with both traditional and fractional capabilities

3. **Data Persistence Layer**
   - Supabase provides the primary database backend
   - Structured data schema designed for vehicle history tracking
   - Efficient querying and relationships between entities

4. **User Integration Layer**
   - Role-based interactions with vehicles (owner, professional, community)
   - Contribution mechanisms for expanding vehicle histories
   - Verification workflows to maintain data integrity
