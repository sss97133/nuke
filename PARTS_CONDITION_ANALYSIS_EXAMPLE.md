- Labor: 1 hour DIY (remove, clean, dye, reinstall)
- Result: Black color restored, still brittle
- Cost: $24 + time
- New grade: 7/10
- New value: $26

**Option B: REPLACE (New vents)**
- Part Cost: $18.95 each × 2 = $37.90 (LMC)
- Labor: 30 minutes DIY
- Total: $37.90
- Result: Perfect black, flexible louvers, grade 10/10

**Recommendation:**
> ✅ **REPLACE** - UV-damaged plastic rarely restores well. New vents are inexpensive ($38) and make huge visual difference.

User clicks at (x: 50%, y: 35%) on interior photo
```

### **Step 2: Dimensional Match**
```sql
SELECT * FROM vehicle_part_locations
WHERE view_angle = 'interior_dash'
  AND 50 BETWEEN x_position_min AND x_position_max
