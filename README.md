# Vehicle Data Infrastructure

We turn scattered car history into structured, tradable intelligence.

---

## What Structured Data Enables

- **Faster sales** — Verified history closes deals. Buyers trust documented provenance.
- **Automated marketing** — Rich vehicle data powers social posts, listings, and alerts without manual work.
- **Transparent accounting** — Every transaction, service record, and ownership change in one auditable trail.
- **Accurate valuations** — Real market data, not guesses. Comps, trends, condition factors.

## How It Works

1. **Aggregate** — Pull history from auctions, forums, registries, service records
2. **Structure** — Normalize into verified timelines with confidence scores
3. **Connect** — Owners, shops, buyers, insurers share one source of truth
