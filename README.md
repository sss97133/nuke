# nuke

A provenance engine that builds knowledge graphs from the traces physical assets leave as they move through networks of people and organizations.

Automotive is the first ontology loaded. It's not the machine.

```
input:  1 auction listing, 1 VIN, 247 photos, 32 comments
output: 10,000+ sourced observations — every claim traced to origin,
        confidence-scored, time-ordered. Nothing overwrites. Everything compounds.
```

| What | Scale |
|------|-------|
| Vehicles | 645,725 entities |
| Images | 32.7M classified by 41-zone taxonomy |
| Auction comments | 11.6M sentiment-scored |
| Sale events | 192,539 across 10+ platforms |
| Valuations | 609,433 nuke estimates (94.4% coverage) |
| Organizations | 4,973 dealers, shops, auction houses |
| Observations | append-only, source-tagged, scored 0-1 |

## The library

The system's knowledge lives in [`docs/library/`](docs/library/README.md). If the code disappeared tomorrow, the library rebuilds it.

**40,000 lines. 50 files. 3% of target scale.** The library grows as a byproduct of work, not as a separate task. See [LIBRARIAN.md](docs/library/LIBRARIAN.md) for contribution rules.

**Vision → SQL**: A photo of an engine bay becomes queryable fields: `air_cleaner_type`, `valve_cover_finish`, `engine_stamp_visible`, `modification_detected`. YONO classifies make in 4ms at $0. Florence-2 maps 41 zones.

**Text → observations**: An auction comment saying "those aren't the right mirrors for a '70 SS" becomes a sourced observation on `component_state.mirrors` with `confidence: 0.50` and a citation back to the original comment.

**Nothing is trusted. Everything is evidence.** Three independent sources confirming the same fact compounds confidence. One contradicting triggers a flag. The system doesn't decide what's true — it shows you what the evidence supports.

## Data model

The database doesn't describe the vehicle. The database **is** the vehicle.

```
vehicle (identity)
  → factory_specification (what it left the factory as)
  → component_state (what it is NOW — per-component condition, mods, replacements)
  → observations (append-only evidence log — every claim traced to source)
  → field_evidence (multi-source provenance per field — agreement, conflict, citations)
  → component_events (who did what, when, where, with what parts)
  → actors (builders, shops, inspectors, owners — reputation through evidence)
  → images (classified by 41-zone taxonomy)
  → market_intelligence (auctions, valuations, comparables across platforms)
```

Sources carry trust: factory data (0.95), major auctions (0.85), forums (0.50), AI extraction (0.70). Confidence decays over time.

## Architecture

```
Vercel (React SPA) ──→ Supabase Edge Functions (Deno) ──→ PostgreSQL v15

## The three entities

```
USER (artist, collector, driver, dealer)
  └── never an asset, always an actor
  └── owns/creates/touches assets through organizations

ORG (magazine, gallery, auction house, shop, racing team)
  └── CAN become an asset (a magazine's archive, a gallery's reputation)
  └── accumulates value through the assets it touches

ASSET (vehicle, painting, magazine issue, photograph, garment)
  └── immutable in identity, accumulates data forever
  └── provenance = the chain of actors who touched it
  └── value is a function of the data accumulated on it
```

Networks are derived from collaborative traces, not declared intent. Two actors are connected because they both touched the same asset, money moved between them, or an organization links them. These traces are permanent.
