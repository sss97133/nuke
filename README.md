# N-Zero

**The living VIN for every build.**

Every car has a VIN that tells where it came from. We're building the platform that tells where it's been and why it matters.

---

## What We Do

We ingest and normalize vehicle data at scale—turning fragmented history across garages, invoices, forums, and auctions into structured, verifiable provenance.

**For Builders:** Stream your builds. Document the craft. Create verified timelines that follow the car forever.

**For Buyers & Collectors:** Access trusted provenance reports. Know the full story before you buy.

**For the Market:** Clean, liquid, investable vehicle data powering trading, auditing, and escrow.

## The Problem

A car's history after the factory is scattered across receipts, forum posts, auction comments, and Instagram stories. Buyers can't verify claims. Collectors can't prove value. Insurers can't assess risk accurately.

The VIN tells you where a car started. Nothing tells you where it's been.
