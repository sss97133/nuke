## üîó Blockchain Integration

Nuke leverages blockchain technology for secure and transparent vehicle management:

### Vehicle NFTs
- Each vehicle gets a unique NFT representing ownership
- Immutable history of ownership transfers
- Smart contract-based authenticity verification
- Automated royalties for original owners on resales

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
// Example Vehicle NFT Contract Structure
contract VehicleNFT is ERC721 {
    struct VehicleData {
        string vin;
        uint256 manufactureYear;
        string make;
        string model;
        address[] previousOwners;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => VehicleData) public vehicles;
}
```

### Decentralized Storage
- Vehicle documentation stored on IPFS
- Maintenance records linked to NFT metadata
- High-resolution photo galleries
- Historical documentation and certificates

## üöÄ Getting Started

## Environment Setup

This project uses different environment configurations for development, testing, and production. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### Development Setup

1. Copy the development environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.development.example .env.development
   ```

2. Update the `.env.development` file with your development Supabase credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_development_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_development_anon_key
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_development_service_key
   VITE_ENV=development
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Test Setup

1. Copy the test environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   ```

2. Update the `.env.test` file with your test Supabase credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_test_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_test_anon_key
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_test_service_key
   VITE_ENV=test
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

### Production Setup

1. Copy the production environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.production.example .env.production
   ```

2. Update the `.env.production` file with your production Supabase credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_production_service_key
   VITE_ENV=production
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Preview the production build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Database Setup

To set up the database policies for vehicle images:

1. Ensure you're using the correct environment (development, test, or production)
2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:policies
   ```

## Security Notes

- Never commit environment files (`.env.*`) to version control
- Keep your service keys secure and rotate them regularly
- Use different Supabase projects for development, testing, and production
- Follow the principle of least privilege when setting up database policies

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run setup:policies` - Set up database policies
