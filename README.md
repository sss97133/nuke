# Nuke

A revolutionary vehicle management platform that serves as the digital identity for vehicles and transforms automotive ownership, investment, and data validation.

## Vision

Nuke is not just a vehicle management systemâ€”it's a comprehensive platform that creates a digital mirror for every vehicle. We're building the ultimate repository of automotive data, where vehicles themselves become digital entities with their own histories, specifications, and economic potential.

### Core Purpose

Our platform serves as:

- A digital identity for individual vehicles
- A comprehensive vehicle history validated through multiple data sources
- A new economic model for automotive investment and ownership
- The ultimate data platform for all automotive recordkeeping

### Target Users

Our ecosystem is designed for:

- **Industry Professionals**: Mechanics, detailers, car salespeople, restoration specialists
- **Vehicle Owners**: From everyday drivers to collectors
- **Automotive Investors**: Who want to participate in vehicle ownership without full title
- **Automotive Enthusiasts**: DIY mechanics, car hobbyists, and collectors
- **The Vehicles Themselves**: As digital entities with their own profiles and data histories

## Current Status

Our CI/CD pipeline has been fixed with comprehensive updates to all GitHub Actions workflows:

- Fixed PATH configuration using GitHub-recommended $GITHUB_PATH approach
- Added proper permissions configuration
- Standardized dependency installation procedures
- Implemented direct executable calling with npx
- Added detailed error handling and diagnostics
- Added Docker integration with automated Docker Hub publishing
- Fixed database schema issues and added migration scripts

## Features
