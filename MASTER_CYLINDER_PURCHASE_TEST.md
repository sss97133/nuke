**Check Your Config:**
```bash
cat ~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

**Should Include:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright"]
    },
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-supabase"]
    }
  }
