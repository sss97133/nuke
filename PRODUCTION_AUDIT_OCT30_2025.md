# 🔍 Production Audit - October 30, 2025

**Audit Time:** 2:10 PM  
**Method:** Browser inspection via Playwright  
**URL:** https://n-zero.dev

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. Production Serving OLD Code ❌

**Current Production (Browser Snapshot):**
- ❌ "💰 6931% GAIN" - Emoji in hero badge
- ❌ "INVEST $10", "INVEST $50", "INVEST $100" buttons
- ❌ "$3", "$10", "$25" buttons in feed cards

**Current GitHub Code (commit `bf04a4e4`):**
- ✅ NO emojis (line 359: `{currentHypeVehicle.hype_reason}`)
- ✅ NO invest buttons in hero (lines 340-494)
- ✅ Clean, professional design implemented

**Root Cause:** Vercel serving cached/stale build

---

## 📊 Site Audit Results

### Navigation ✅
- Logo: "n-zero" → Links to /
- Home → /dashboard
- Vehicles → /vehicles
- Market → /market
- Organizations → /shops
- Login button visible

### Hero Banner (❌ Stale Content)
**Showing:**
- Vehicle: "1977 Chevrolet K5"
- Badge: "💰 6931% GAIN" ← EMOJI FOUND
- Stats: "$141k", "↑ 6931%", "1 photos", "145 events", "43 views"
- Buttons: "INVEST $10", "INVEST $50", "INVEST $100" ← SHOULD NOT EXIST

### Stats Bar ✅
- "19 active builds"
- "$645k in play"
- "3 updated today"

### Feed Section (❌ Old Buttons)
- Heading: "What's Popping"
- Subtitle: "16 vehicles · Updated just now"
- Feed cards showing with "$3", "$10", "$25" buttons ← SHOULD NOT EXIST

---

## 🔍 Database Connection Check

**Attempt:** Direct psql connection to verify RLS policies  
**Result:** ❌ Connection failed - "Tenant or user not found"

**Note:** Using pooler URL instead of direct URL. Need to use Supabase client or correct connection string.

---

## ✅ What SHOULD Be Live (Per Git Commit bf04a4e4)

### Homepage (CursorHomepage.tsx)

**Hero Banner:**
```tsx
// Line 359: Clean badge (no emoji)
{currentHypeVehicle.hype_reason}  // Shows: "GAIN", "TRENDING", etc.

// Lines 340-494: NO INVEST BUTTONS
// Just clickable year/make/model + stats
```

**Feed Cards:**
```tsx
// No "$3/$10/$25" buttons
// Just vehicle info + clickable elements
```

## 🐛 Why Production Is Out of Sync

### Possible Causes:

1. **Vercel Build Cache** ❌
   - Previous deployment cached
   - New commits not triggering rebuild

2. **Environment Variables Missing** ⚠️
   - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
   - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - May cause fallback to old code

3. **Git Push Timing** ⚠️
   - Commits pushed but Vercel webhook not fired
   - Manual redeploy needed

---

## 🔧 Required Fixes

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Clear Vercel Cache & Redeploy**
```bash
# Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard
Visit: https://vercel.com/nzero/nuke/deployments
Click: "Redeploy" on latest deployment
Check: "Clear cache"

# Option B: Via CLI
vercel --prod --force
```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard, check:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://tzorvvtvzrfqkdshcijr.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[key]
```

3. **Force Git Trigger**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "🔄 FORCE: Trigger Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After redeployment, verify:

- [ ] Hero badge shows NO emojis (just "GAIN", "TRENDING", etc.)
- [ ] Hero banner has NO "INVEST" buttons
- [ ] Feed cards have NO "$3/$10/$25" buttons
- [ ] Year/make/model are clickable
- [ ] Time period filters visible
- [ ] "What's Popping" header clean
- [ ] Stats bar shows correct data
- [ ] All navigation links work

---

## 🗄️ Database RLS Status

**Unable to verify via direct psql** - Need Supabase client check

**Last Known State (from earlier today):**
```sql
-- vehicles table UPDATE policies
✅ "Authenticated users can update any vehicle" - ALLOWS ALL
✅ "vehicles_admin_owner_update" - ALLOWS ALL
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Any authenticated user can UPDATE vehicles table
- ✅ Price saves should work
- ✅ Vehicle data edits should work

---

## 🎯 Summary

### Code Status: ✅ CLEAN
- Git repo has correct code (no emojis, no invest buttons)
- All fixes committed and pushed
- TypeScript/linter clean

### Production Status: ❌ STALE
- Serving old cached build
- Shows emojis and invest buttons that were removed
- Needs forced redeployment

### Database Status: ⚠️ ASSUMED GOOD
- Last verified 2 hours ago as working
- Price saves were fixed
- RLS policies simplified

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Redeploy Production** (Vercel)
   - Clear build cache
   - Force fresh build
   - Verify new deployment ID

2. **Test After Deployment**
   - Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Check for emojis (should be gone)
   - Check for invest buttons (should be gone)
   - Verify clickable elements work

3. **Database Verification** (Optional)
   - Use Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Run: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'vehicles' AND cmd = 'UPDATE';`
   - Confirm 2 ALLOW ALL policies exist
