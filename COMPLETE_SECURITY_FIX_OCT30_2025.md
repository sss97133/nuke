# ✅ Complete Security Fix - October 30, 2025

**Time:** 2:35 PM  
**Status:** 🟢 FRONTEND FIXED + RLS SQL READY

---

## 🔒 WHAT WAS FIXED

### ✅ Frontend Security (DEPLOYED)

**File:** `MobileVehicleProfile.tsx`  
**Commit:** `d65077a6`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added ownership check functions to all tabs
2. ✅ Restricted "Edit Price" button to owners/contributors
3. ✅ Restricted "Upload Doc" button to owners/contributors
4. ✅ Restricted "Edit Vehicle Data" button to owners/contributors
5. ✅ Restricted "Add Photos" button to owners/contributors
6. ✅ Restricted camera FAB to owners/contributors
7. ✅ Added permission checks in upload handlers

**Result:** Non-owners can no longer see or access edit buttons

---

### ⏳ Backend Security (SQL READY - NEEDS EXECUTION)

**File:** `FIX_RLS_OWNER_ONLY.sql` (ready to run)

**Policies to Apply:**
1. ✅ Drop permissive "any authenticated user" policies
2. ✅ Create "Only owners and contributors can update vehicles"
3. ✅ Create "Only owners and contributors can upload images"
4. ✅ Create "Users can delete their own images"
5. ✅ Create "Only owners and contributors can upload documents"
6. ✅ Create "Users can delete their own documents"

**Result:** Database enforces same restrictions as frontend

---

## 🎯 HOW PERMISSIONS WORK NOW

```

**Check:**
```typescript

WHERE role IN ('owner', 'co_owner', 'restorer', 'moderator', 'consigner')
```

---

### Regular Users (Logged In) ✅
**Can:**
- ✅ View all public vehicles

## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER

### Before Fix ❌
```
Logged-Out User    → Edit buttons: ❌ NOT VISIBLE
Regular User       → Edit buttons: ✅ VISIBLE (WRONG!)
Vehicle Owner      → Edit buttons: ✅ VISIBLE
Contributor        → Edit buttons: ❌ NOT VISIBLE (WRONG!)
```

**Problems:**
- Regular users could edit any vehicle
- Contributors couldn't edit vehicles they should access
- Database allowed any authenticated user to update

### After Fix ✅
```
Logged-Out User    → Edit buttons: ❌ NOT VISIBLE ✅
Regular User       → Edit buttons: ❌ NOT VISIBLE ✅
Vehicle Owner      → Edit buttons: ✅ VISIBLE ✅
Contributor        → Edit buttons: ✅ VISIBLE ✅
```

**Fixed:**
- Only owners/contributors see edit buttons
- Database will enforce same restrictions (after RLS applied)
- Proper role-based access control

---

## 🔧 DATABASE FIX - NEEDS TO BE RUN

### Option 1: Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://tzorvvtvzrfqkdshcijr.supabase.co/project/default/sql
2. Open `FIX_RLS_OWNER_ONLY.sql`
3. Copy and paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify policies updated

### Option 2: Direct psql (If you have correct connection string)

```bash
psql "postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.tzorvvtvzrfqkdshcijr.supabase.co:5432/postgres" \
  -f FIX_RLS_OWNER_ONLY.sql
```

### What It Does

**Before (Too Permissive):**
```sql
"Authenticated users can update any vehicle"  -- ALLOWS ALL ❌
"vehicles_admin_owner_update"                 -- ALLOWS ALL ❌
```

**After (Properly Restricted):**
```sql
"Only owners and contributors can update vehicles"
  USING (
    auth.uid() = uploaded_by            -- Vehicle owner
    OR auth.uid() = user_id             -- Alternative owner field
    OR role IN ('owner', 'restorer'...) -- Contributor with rights
  )
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

### After RLS is applied, test:

**As Vehicle Owner:**
```
1. Log in
2. Visit YOUR vehicle
3. ✅ Should see "Edit Price", "Upload Doc", "Edit Data" buttons
4. ✅ Should be able to save changes
5. ✅ Database should accept updates
```

**As Regular User:**
```
1. Log in
2. Visit SOMEONE ELSE'S vehicle
3. ❌ Should NOT see any edit buttons
4. ❌ Even if you manually call functions, database should reject
```

**As Contributor:**
```
1. Log in
2. Visit vehicle where you're added as "restorer"
3. ✅ Should see all edit buttons
4. ✅ Should be able to make changes
5. ✅ Database should accept updates
```

### ⏳ What Needs Manual Action

**Database RLS:**
- ⏳ SQL prepared in `FIX_RLS_OWNER_ONLY.sql`
- ⏳ Needs to be run in Supabase SQL Editor
