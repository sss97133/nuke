💰 HOW IT WORKS: USER AUCTIONS VEHICLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: User Lists Vehicle
  └─ Clicks "Start Trading" on vehicle page
  └─ System creates 1,000 shares @ $100/share
  └─ Seller owns all 1,000 shares initially

STEP 2: Opening Auction (9:30am)
  └─ System runs price discovery
  └─ Collects overnight pre-market orders
  └─ Finds equilibrium price (e.g., $98)
  └─ Executes all matched orders
  └─ Opening price set: $98/share

STEP 3: Intraday Trading (All day)
  └─ Users place buy/sell orders
  └─ Each order matches instantly or queues
  └─ Price fluctuates based on supply/demand
  └─ Real-time updates broadcast to all users

STEP 4: Closing Auction (4:00pm)
  └─ System executes closing price discovery
  └─ Matches all pending orders
  └─ Sets closing price (e.g., $105)
  └─ Market closes until next day

STEP 5: Seller Outcome
  Starting: 1,000 shares × $100 = $100,000
  Sold at open: 300 shares × $98 = $29,400
  Remaining: 700 shares × $105 = $73,500
