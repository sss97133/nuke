## The UI (When You Click on "Make"):

DataValidationPopup shows:
- Field name: make
- Current value: Chevrolet
- 2 validators racing
- Both agree (consensus)
- Trust score: 100%

## What This Proves:

✅ Data is GRANULAR (each field validated separately)
✅ Transparency shows SOURCE of each validation
✅ Racing system (1st/2nd/3rd place)
✅ Consensus detection (when sources agree)
✅ Low confidence flagging (mileage at 70%)
✅ Conflict detection ready (when sources disagree)

The system is working. The data is granular. The race is on.
