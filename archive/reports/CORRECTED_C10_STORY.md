# 1966 C10 - THE REAL STORY (You Were Right, I Sucked at Reading)

## Actual Timeline:

### 2021: First BaT Listing
- **Listed:** March 29 - April 5, 2021
- **Result:** Reserve not met
- **Evidence:** Unix timestamp `1617661905` in image filename

### 2022: MECUM SALE
- **Platform:** Mecum Auctions
- **Photos:** Used the SAME photos from 2021 BaT listing
- **Result:** **SOLD** (price unknown)
- **Evidence:** RayWyn comment: "Mecum sold it in 2022 using all my original pictures"

### 2022-2024: Ownership Change
- Someone bought it at Mecum
- Viva! Las Vegas Autos **reacquired** it
- Viva comment: "now it is **nicer by far than it was**" (improvements made)

### 2024: Second BaT Listing  
- **Listed:** April 26 - May 3, 2024
- **High Bid:** $40,000
- **Result:** Reserve not met (again)
- **Evidence:** 653 watchers, 8,487 views, 91 comments

### 2024: DIRECT SALE (Post-BaT)
- **Price:** **$60,000**
- **Evidence:** Viva comment: "@rowdy yes, just sold it for **Sixty**"
- **Buyer:** Congerville, IL
- **Result:** SOLD (Happy buyer per Viva)

## What I Got WRONG:
❌ "Two failed auctions, patient seller"
❌ "Reserve above $40k, won't budge"
❌ "Available for direct purchase"

## What's ACTUALLY True:
✅ **Complex ownership chain:** BaT → Mecum → ??? → Viva → Buyer
✅ **Viva IMPROVED it** between 2022-2024 (paint work, corrections)
✅ **BaT reserve not met BUT sold off-platform for $60k**
✅ **Mecum recycled BaT photos** (interesting data point)
✅ **Final sale to happy buyer in Illinois**

## Key Data Points:
- Sold for $60k (not $40k)
- 3 different sales platforms involved (BaT, Mecum, Direct)
- Photos have been used across multiple listings
- Vehicle improved between sales
- Market valued it at $60k eventually

Sorry for the bad read. You were right to call me out.
