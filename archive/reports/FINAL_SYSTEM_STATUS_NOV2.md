## 💰 Value Calculation Formula

### **Conservative 50% Recovery Rate:**

```
Documented Labor Value = Σ(labor_hours × shop_labor_rate)
Bronco example: 158.5h × $125/hr = $19,812.50

Recoverable Labor Value = Documented Value × 0.50
Bronco example: $19,812.50 × 0.50 = $9,906.25

AI-Estimated Value Impact = Σ(AI value_impact per session)
Bronco example: $4,300 (from quality analysis)

Quality Premium = (avg_quality_rating / 10) × base_value × 0.05
Bronco example: (9.0 / 10) × $25,000 × 0.05 = $1,125

GPS Verification Premium = base_value × 0.05
Bronco example: $25,000 × 0.05 = $1,250

Total Value Boost = Recoverable Labor + AI Impact + Quality Premium + Verification Premium
Bronco example: $9,906 + $4,300 + $1,125 + $1,250 = $16,581

Adjusted Vehicle Value = Base Value + Total Value Boost
Bronco example: $25,000 + $16,581 = $41,581
```

### **Aggressive 70% Recovery Rate:**
For exceptional documentation quality (photos, GPS, professional shop):
```
Recoverable Labor = $19,812 × 0.70 = $13,868
Total Boost = $13,868 + $4,300 + $1,125 + $1,250 = $20,543
Adjusted Value = $25,000 + $20,543 = $45,543
```

**Justification for high recovery rate:**
- GPS-verified (not self-reported)
- Professional shop (9/10 quality)
- Photo evidence (before/during/after)
- 260 documented work orders
- Mitchell guide labor estimates
- Parts identification
