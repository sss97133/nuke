### 5. Data Flow Pipeline
The 3-entity data flow is established:

```
User uploads image → Organization Profile
    ↓
EXIF extraction (date, GPS, camera)
    ↓
organization_images INSERT
    ↓
TRIGGER: update_organization_stats()
    ↓
businesses.total_images++
    ↓
business_timeline_events INSERT (with EXIF date)
    ↓
organization_contributors upsert
    ↓
Timeline shows on:
  - Organization profile
  - User profile (via organization_contributors)
  - Future: Work orders (when linked)
```

## Design Decisions

### No Emojis Policy [[memory:10633712]]
- Replaced all emojis with text labels
- PRIMARY, SCAN, DELETE instead of ⭐🔍🗑
- FOLLOW instead of 👥
- Cleaner, more professional appearance

### First Contributor Control
- Addresses the collaborative Wikipedia model
- Prevents org profiles from being "orphaned"
- Rewards data entry with temporary control
- Control transfers when ownership claimed

### Simplified Org Cards
- Primary focus: Visual identity (logo/image)
- Key metrics: Work orders, labor rate, followers
- Contact buried in profile (not needed on cards)
- Legal names removed (redundant, clutters UI)
