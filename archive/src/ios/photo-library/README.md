# iOS Photo Library Integration

This directory contains code intended for future iOS implementation when this web application is repackaged as a native iOS app.

## Implementation Plan

When building the iOS version, these utilities will allow the app to:
1. Request full access to the user's photo library
2. Fetch all images from the library
3. Process and upload them to associate with vehicles
4. Handle background uploads and batching

## Integration Points

This functionality will integrate with the existing vehicle image management system, specifically:
- Vehicle gallery in VehicleDetail.tsx
- Image upload modal in ImageUploadModal.tsx
- The vehicle creation flow in AddVehicle.tsx

## Current Web Limitations

This functionality is iOS-specific and requires:
- Native iOS capabilities (PHPhotoLibrary, PHAsset)
- Swift/Objective-C implementation
- iOS app permissions

The code in this directory serves as a reference and planning document for future iOS development.
