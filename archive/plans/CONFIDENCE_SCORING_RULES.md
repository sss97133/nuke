# Confidence Scoring Rules

## High Confidence (85-100%) - GREEN
- Public auction results (BaT, Mecum, RM Sotheby's)
- Direct seller/buyer statements
- Institutional validation (VIN from Mecum)
- Manufacturer specs
- Government records (title, registration)

## Medium Confidence (60-84%) - YELLOW  
- Crowdsourced (multiple users agree)
- Historical records (old ads, brochures)
- Estimated values
- Dealer claims (without proof)

## Low Confidence (30-59%) - ORANGE
- Single unverified source
- User input (no supporting docs)
- Needs more validation

## Red Flag (<30%) - RED
- **Contradictions** (data sources disagree)
- **Decreasing mileage** (odometer rollback)
- **Impossible specs** (doesn't match OEM data)
- **Suspicious changes** (VIN mismatch, title issues)

## Mileage-Specific Rules:
✅ **Current reading reliable** (even if "total unknown")
⚠️ **Flag only if DECREASES** between readings
✅ **Natural increase expected** over time
✅ **"Total unknown" is NORMAL** for vintage vehicles (odometer rolls over at 99,999)

## The Point:
Don't flag warnings on normal data.
Flag CONTRADICTIONS and IMPOSSIBLE changes.
