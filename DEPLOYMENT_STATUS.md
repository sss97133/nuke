# Deployment Status - October 18, 2025

## ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION (Vercel)

### Commit History
1. **d679a88d** - Image Uploader Consolidation
2. **34a7a49d** - Add Vehicle Consolidation  
3. **07c18c09** - Documentation
4. **46814140** - Migration deployment tools

---

## PHASE 1: Image Upload Consolidation ✅ LIVE

**What's Working:**
- ✅ All image uploaders use ImageUploadService
- ✅ EXIF dates extracted correctly
- ✅ Timeline events created with photo date (not upload date)
- ✅ Multi-resolution variants generated
- ✅ Background AI processing triggered
- ✅ User contributions tracked on correct dates

**Files Modified:**
- ImageUploader.tsx (228 → 137 lines)
- BulkImageUploader.tsx (refactored)
- globalUploadQueue.ts (simplified)
- imageUploadService.ts (added AI trigger)

**Net:** -400 lines

---

## PHASE 2: Add Vehicle Consolidation ✅ LIVE

**What's Working:**
- ✅ One AddVehicle component (replaces 2)
- ✅ Modal mode (Discovery feed + button)
- ✅ Page mode (/add-vehicle route)
- ✅ URL deduplication (checks discovery_url)
- ✅ Discoverer ranking (#1, #2, #3, etc.)
- ✅ No validation barriers (submit anything)
- ✅ VIN safety (no VIN = stays private)

**Files Modified:**
- AddVehicle.tsx (added modal mode + URL dedup)
- Discovery.tsx (uses AddVehicle modal)

**Files Deleted:**
- QuickVehicleAdd.tsx (-400 lines)
- AddVehicleRedirect.tsx (-50 lines)

**Net:** -450 lines

---

## PHASE 3: Algorithmic Completion ⏳ PENDING

**Status:** SQL migration file created, needs manual execution

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251018_algorithmic_completion.sql`

**What It Does:**
```
Completion % = 
  Timeline Depth (40%) - event quality × contributor skill × time span
  + Field Coverage (25%) - filled fields vs cohort average
  + Market Verification (20%) - VIN + BAT + pricing data
  + Trust Score (15%) - docs + consensus + virality

Score is RELATIVE and IN FLUX
```

**Why Not Deployed:**
- Supabase CLI auth issues (SCRAM auth failure)
- Database password mismatch
- Edge functions can't execute DDL

**Manual Deployment Required:**

### Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qkgaybvrernstplzjaam/sql/new
2. Paste contents of: `supabase/migrations/20251018_algorithmic_completion.sql`
3. Click RUN
4. Test with: `node scripts/test-completion-algorithm.js`

### Option B: psql (If you have correct password)
```bash
psql "postgresql://postgres.qkgaybvrernstplzjaam:[CORRECT_PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres" \
  -f supabase/migrations/20251018_algorithmic_completion.sql
```

## What's Working Right Now (Without SQL Migration)

### ✅ User Can:
1. Add vehicle via modal (+ button on Discovery)
2. Add vehicle via page (/add-vehicle)
3. Paste URL → auto-scrape → check duplicates → create
4. Drop photos → EXIF extraction → timeline events
5. Upload with no validation (submit anything)
6. Get credited as discoverer #2/#3 if URL exists

### ⏳ Once SQL Migration Runs:
7. Vehicles get algorithmic completion % (timeline-first)
8. Scores update automatically on changes
9. Cohort ranking shows relative position
10. Scores flux as better vehicles added

---

## Error Summary

**CLI Auth Error:**
```
failed SASL auth (invalid SCRAM server-final-message)
```

**Possible Causes:**
- Password in .env is incorrect/outdated
- Need to use direct database URL not pooler
- Project not properly linked

**Workaround:**
- Manual execution via Supabase Dashboard ✅
- All code changes already deployed ✅
- Only SQL function needs deployment ⏳

---

## Next Steps

1. **Execute SQL migration** (manual in Dashboard)
2. **Run tests:** `node scripts/test-completion-algorithm.js`
3. **Test add vehicle flow:**
   - Modal from Discovery
   - Page from /add-vehicle  
   - URL deduplication
4. **Monitor completion scores** as they calculate

---

## Total Lines Changed

**Removed:** ~900 lines of redundant code
**Added:** ~1500 lines (consolidation + algorithm + docs)
**Net:** Cleaner, more powerful system

**All features working except SQL migration (needs manual deploy).**
