# Nuke Platform Zoning Architecture

This directory implements a zone-based UI architecture that organizes the application into distinct functional areas. Each zone has its own responsibility and visual identity while maintaining cohesive communication with other zones.

## Zone Structure

1. **Identity Zone**
   - Core vehicle profile information
   - Digital lifecycle visualization
   - Key stats and trust indicators
   - Immutable vehicle attributes

2. **Timeline Zone**
   - Chronological vehicle history
   - Multi-source data aggregation
   - Event confidence visualization
   - Temporal navigation

3. **Verification Zone**
   - PTZ verification interface
   - Professional recognition elements
   - Trust mechanism visualization
   - Documentation upload and validation

4. **Community Zone**
   - User interaction and engagement
   - Fractional ownership interface
   - Content creation and sharing
   - Social proof elements

5. **Navigation Zone**
   - Global application navigation
   - Context-aware controls
   - User profile and settings
   - Search and discovery tools

## Implementation Guidelines

- Each zone is implemented as a React component with its own directory
- Zones communicate through a zone messaging system
- Zones follow the iOS 18/desktop app aesthetic guidelines
- All zones use real vehicle data (no mock data)
- Performance is prioritized with lazy-loading patterns
