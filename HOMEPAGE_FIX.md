# Homepage Fix Applied ✅

## Issue Identified

The homepage (`/`) was showing the `Discovery` page which displays:
- ❌ Generic activity feed with repetitive "Photo Added" cards
- ❌ Not vehicle-focused
- ❌ Poor user experience

## Solution Applied

**Changed homepage route**:
```diff
- <Route path="/" element={<Discovery />} />
+ <Route path="/" element={<AllVehicles />} />
```

## What AllVehicles Shows Instead

✅ **Vehicle-focused homepage**:
- Vehicle cards with images, pricing, stats
- "Discover Amazing Vehicles" welcome section
- Advanced search functionality
- Market pulse data
- Recent activity (vehicle-focused)
- Proper stats: "X vehicles • Y members • Z added this week"

✅ **Better UX**:
- Shows actual vehicles instead of generic activity
- Vehicle thumbnails with pricing
- Search and filter capabilities
- Professional vehicle marketplace feel

## Routes Now:

- `/` → `AllVehicles` (vehicle marketplace homepage)
- `/discover` → `Discovery` (activity feed for those who want it)
- `/dashboard` → `Dashboard` (user's vehicle management)
- `/vehicles` → `Vehicles` (user's vehicle list)

## Result

The homepage now shows a proper vehicle marketplace instead of a generic activity feed, which is much more appropriate for a vehicle platform.
