**Generated**: 2025-10-26T23:07:44Z  
**Repository**: sss97133/nuke  
**Total Open PRs**: 21  

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive audit analyzed all 21 open pull requests in the repository to detect duplicates, overlapping work, and provide actionable recommendations. The analysis identified significant opportunities for cleanup and consolidation.

## Key Findings

### Action Breakdown
- **CLOSE** (9 PRs): Stale or duplicate PRs that should be closed
- **KEEP** (10 PRs): Active PRs requiring manual review or continued development  
- **MANUAL-REVIEW** (2 PRs): PRs touching sensitive areas requiring careful review

### Duplicate Detection Results
- **Title Matches**: Found several PRs with identical or very similar titles
- **Branch Matches**: Identified PRs using the same branch names
- **File Overlap**: Detected 210 pairwise comparisons with varying degrees of file overlap
- **High Overlap Groups**: 15 duplicate groups identified across different criteria

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Ready for Action)
- 9 PRs recommended for closure (stale or duplicates)
- Clear rationale provided for each closure recommendation

### Medium Risk (Requires Review)
- 10 PRs marked as "keep" - active development or large features
- Most require manual review due to size or complexity

### High Risk (Manual Review Required)
- 2 PRs touching sensitive files (migrations, payments, etc.)
- These should NOT be merged automatically

## Safety Measures Implemented

✅ **Read-Only Operations**: All analysis was performed without modifying any PRs  
✅ **Dry-Run Commands**: All suggested actions provided as echo commands  
✅ **Risk Flagging**: Sensitive files (DB, payments, webhooks) flagged for manual review  
✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations logged for audit trail  

## Deliverables Generated

1. **pr_report.json** - Complete metadata for all 21 PRs
2. **duplicate_groups.json** - Detailed duplicate analysis by title, branch, and file overlap
3. **overlap_matrix.csv** - Pairwise file overlap analysis (210 comparisons)
4. **suggested_actions.md** - Detailed recommendations for each PR
5. **dry_run_commands.sh** - Safe, copy-pasteable commands (with echo prefix)
6. **logs.txt** - Complete execution log

## Next Steps

1. **Review suggested_actions.md** for detailed per-PR recommendations
2. **Examine duplicate_groups.json** to understand overlap patterns
3. **Execute dry_run_commands.sh** after removing echo prefixes (if approved)
4. **Manually review** the 2 high-risk PRs before any merge decisions

## Important Notes

⚠️ **DO NOT** execute the dry run commands without manual review  
⚠️ **VERIFY** all closure decisions before executing  
⚠️ **TEST** any merges in a staging environment first  
⚠️ **BACKUP** important branches before any destructive operations
