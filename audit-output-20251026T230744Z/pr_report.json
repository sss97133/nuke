This caused a React hook error (\"Rendered fewer hooks than expected\") because the `isMobile` state could change after initial mount, leading to a different number of hooks being called between renders. The fix moves the conditional rendering of the mobile component to after all hooks have been declared, ensuring consistent hook order. Additionally, `MobileAddVehicle.tsx` was using `useAuth` without importing it, which has been corrected.\n\n---\n<a href=\"https://cursor.com/background-agent?bcId=bc-8b17a3c8-10b1-4784-98dd-a150d54d58b5\"><picture><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor-dark.svg\"><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor-light.svg\"><img alt=\"Open in Cursor\" src=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor.svg\"></picture></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cursor.com/agents?id=bc-8b17a3c8-10b1-4784-98dd-a150d54d58b5\"><picture><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web-dark.svg\"><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web-light.svg\"><img alt=\"Open in Web\" src=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web.svg\"></picture></a>\n\n","changedFiles":2,"commits":[{"authoredDate":"2025-10-19T21:49:27Z","authors":[{"email":"cursoragent@cursor.com","id":"U_kgDOC972lw","login":"cursoragent","name":"Cursor Agent"},{"email":"shkylar@gmail.com","id":"U_kgDOC1OVfQ","login":"sss97133","name":"shkylar"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-19T21:49:27Z","messageBody":"Co-authored-by: shkylar <shkylar@gmail.com>","messageHeadline":"Refactor: Use mobile hook after all other hooks","oid":"79658ea75c0d6e4b9c7d4710b9bc200140342e6e"}],"createdAt":"2025-10-19T21:49:32Z","deletions":10,"files":[{"path":"nuke_frontend/src/components/mobile/MobileAddVehicle.tsx","additions":1,"deletions":0},{"path":"nuke_frontend/src/pages/add-vehicle/AddVehicle.tsx","additions":10,"deletions":10}],"headRefName":"cursor/debug-rendering-error-with-hooks-e913","headRefOid":"79658ea75c0d6e4b9c7d4710b9bc200140342e6e","isDraft":true,"labels":[],"mergeStateStatus":"UNKNOWN","mergeable":"UNKNOWN","milestone":null,"number":142,"reviewDecision":"","statusCheckRollup":[{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-19T21:50:27Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/actions/runs/18636566666/job/53128529929","name":"Analyze (actions)","startedAt":"2025-10-19T21:49:38Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"CodeQL"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-19T21:51:28Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/actions/runs/18636566666/job/53128529928","name":"Analyze (javascript-typescript)","startedAt":"2025-10-19T21:49:38Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"CodeQL"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-19T21:50:38Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/actions/runs/18636566666/job/53128529939","name":"Analyze (python)","startedAt":"2025-10-19T21:49:38Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"CodeQL"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-19T21:50:19Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/runs/53128544767","name":"CodeQL","startedAt":"2025-10-19T21:50:17Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":""},{"__typename":"StatusContext","context":"CodeRabbit","startedAt":"2025-10-19T21:49:42Z","state":"SUCCESS","targetUrl":""},{"__typename":"StatusContext","context":"Vercel","startedAt":"2025-10-19T21:49:53Z","state":"SUCCESS","targetUrl":"https://vercel.com/nzero/nuke/77kzLnd5zG5DFmYynezjGUsacEoZ"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-19T21:49:55Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://vercel.com/github","name":"Vercel Preview Comments","startedAt":"2025-10-19T21:49:55Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":""}],"title":"Debug rendering error with hooks","updatedAt":"2025-10-19T21:49:55Z","url":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/pull/142"}

This PR addresses these issues by updating the viewport, adding mobile-first Tailwind container/screens, correcting global CSS for responsive media and overflow, and enabling the header's mobile menu. Additionally, the homepage's 'Join Community' action was updated to use the correct `/login` route, aligning with design system expectations.\n\n---\n<a href=\"https://cursor.com/background-agent?bcId=bc-137f3b5e-12a7-4ec7-957e-b48042c53096\"><picture><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor-dark.svg\"><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor-light.svg\"><img alt=\"Open in Cursor\" src=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor.svg\"></picture></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cursor.com/agents?id=bc-137f3b5e-12a7-4ec7-957e-b48042c53096\"><picture><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web-dark.svg\"><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web-light.svg\"><img alt=\"Open in Web\" src=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web.svg\"></picture></a>\n\n","changedFiles":5,"commits":[{"authoredDate":"2025-10-18T00:52:51Z","authors":[{"email":"cursoragent@cursor.com","id":"U_kgDOC972lw","login":"cursoragent","name":"Cursor Agent"},{"email":"shkylar@gmail.com","id":"U_kgDOC1OVfQ","login":"sss97133","name":"shkylar"}],"committedDate":"2025-10-18T00:52:51Z","messageBody":"Co-authored-by: shkylar <shkylar@gmail.com>","messageHeadline":"Refactor: Improve mobile responsiveness and UI elements","oid":"c1614be798c7e7b9e4d54ffa6c9a9eb52e46368a"}],"createdAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:03Z","deletions":4,"files":[{"path":"nuke_frontend/index.html","additions":1,"deletions":1},{"path":"nuke_frontend/src/components/landing/QuickActions.tsx","additions":1,"deletions":1},{"path":"nuke_frontend/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx","additions":2,"deletions":2},{"path":"nuke_frontend/src/index.css","additions":18,"deletions":0},{"path":"nuke_frontend/tailwind.config.js","additions":17,"deletions":0}],"headRefName":"cursor/mobile-site-fix-and-homepage-redesign-15b4","headRefOid":"c1614be798c7e7b9e4d54ffa6c9a9eb52e46368a","isDraft":true,"labels":[],"mergeStateStatus":"UNKNOWN","mergeable":"UNKNOWN","milestone":null,"number":129,"reviewDecision":"","statusCheckRollup":[{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:36Z","conclusion":"FAILURE","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/actions/runs/18608315662/job/53061946413","name":"Analyze (actions)","startedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:08Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"CodeQL"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-18T00:54:56Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/actions/runs/18608315662/job/53061946421","name":"Analyze (javascript-typescript)","startedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:11Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"CodeQL"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:58Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/actions/runs/18608315662/job/53061946414","name":"Analyze (python)","startedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:08Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":"CodeQL"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:50Z","conclusion":"NEUTRAL","detailsUrl":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/runs/53061966747","name":"CodeQL","startedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:48Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":""},{"__typename":"StatusContext","context":"CodeRabbit","startedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:12Z","state":"SUCCESS","targetUrl":""},{"__typename":"StatusContext","context":"Vercel","startedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:14Z","state":"SUCCESS","targetUrl":"https://vercel.com/nzero/nuke/zU8USLkAjVYRFqmXF1tr5HhWBqbo"},{"__typename":"CheckRun","completedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:15Z","conclusion":"SUCCESS","detailsUrl":"https://vercel.com/github","name":"Vercel Preview Comments","startedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:15Z","status":"COMPLETED","workflowName":""}],"title":"Mobile site fix and homepage redesign","updatedAt":"2025-10-18T00:53:15Z","url":"https://github.com/sss97133/nuke/pull/129"}
