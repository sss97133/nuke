# ü§ñ Vehicle Expert Agent - AI Valuation Pipeline

## Design Philosophy

**Core Principle:** AI must become an instant expert on the specific vehicle before assessing value.

### The Pipeline (Your Specification):

```
STEP 1: Research Vehicle Y/M/M
  ‚Üì Assemble accessible literature
  ‚Üì Become instant expert
  ‚Üì Build mental model: manuals, forums, market data
  
STEP 2: Assess Images
  ‚Üì Properly analyze all photos
  ‚Üì Identify components with VALUE
  ‚Üì Tally up value anywhere visible
  
STEP 3: Environmental Data
  ‚Üì Extract from EXIF metadata first
  ‚Üì Then visual analysis of images
  ‚Üì Answer the 5 W's: Who, What, When, Where, Why
  
STEP 4: Value Justification
  ‚Üì Generate comprehensive explanation
  ‚Üì Answer: "WHY is this worth $X?"
  ‚Üì Visual evidence for every claim
```

## Implementation

### Edge Function: `vehicle-expert-agent`

**Deployed:** ‚úÖ October 31, 2025  
**Endpoint:** `https://qkgaybvrernstplzjaam.supabase.co/functions/v1/vehicle-expert-agent`

### Usage:

```typescript
const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke('vehicle-expert-agent', {
  body: { vehicleId: 'xxx-xxx-xxx' }
});

// Returns ExpertValuation with full breakdown
```

---

## STEP 1: Research & Become Expert

### Vehicle Context Assembled:

```typescript
{
  // Basic identification
  year: 1974,
  make: "Ford",
  model: "Bronco",
  vin: "U15TLT18338",
  
  // Literature (AI-researched)
  commonIssues: [
    "Frame rust (especially rear spring mounts)",
    "Carburetor flooding (351W common issue)",
    "Brake master cylinder leaks",
    "Transfer case oil seals"
  ],
  forumKnowledge: [
    "1974 was last year for small Bronco (valuable)",
    "351W V8 most desirable engine option",
    "Dana 44 front axle stock (strong, reliable)",
    "Prices doubled 2020-2025 for clean examples"
  ],
  
  // Market intelligence
  marketSales: [
    { price: 45000, condition: "Good", date: "2025-09", source: "BaT" },
    { price: 68000, condition: "Excellent", date: "2025-08", source: "Cars&Bids" },
    { price: 32000, condition: "Fair", date: "2025-07", source: "Craigslist" }
  ],
  marketAverage: 48333,
  marketRange: { low: 32000, high: 68000 }
}
```

**AI becomes instant expert by:**
1. Querying market_data for comparable sales
2. Research prompt asking GPT-4 for Y/M/M specific knowledge
3. Cross-referencing forum data (enthusiast priorities)
4. Understanding what makes THIS vehicle valuable vs similar ones

---

## STEP 2: Assess Images & Tally Value

### Component Identification:

**For each component found, AI provides:**

```typescript
{
  name: "Front Dana 44 Axle Assembly",
  partNumber: "DANA-44-FRONT",
  condition: "Very Good",
  conditionGrade: 8,
  estimatedValue: 450,        // Current value in this condition
  newPrice: 895,              // New replacement cost
  
  evidence: {
    imageUrls: ["img1_thumb.jpg", "img2_thumb.jpg"],
    photoCount: 12,
    location: "Front undercarriage",
    datePhotographed: "2025-10-27"
  },
  
  confidence: 90,
  reasoning: "Dana 44 front axle for 1974 Bronco runs $800-1000 new. 
             This unit shows light surface rust but no structural damage, 
             good gear oil visible, intact boots. Comparable used units 
             sell for $400-500. Grade 8/10 condition = ~50% of new value."
}
```

**AI analyzes ~30 sampled photos** (every 5th image) to:
- Identify substantial components (>$50 value)
- Assess condition visually (rust, wear, damage)
- Reference market prices for parts
- Explain reasoning for each value

---

## STEP 3: Environmental Context (5 W's)

### Data Extraction:

**From EXIF Metadata:**
```typescript
{
  gpsLocations: [
    { lat: 35.9726, lng: -114.8549, count: 145 },  // Primary location
    { lat: 36.1234, lng: -115.1234, count: 15 }    // Secondary
  ],
  cameraEquipment: ["Apple iPhone 14 Pro"],
  photoTimeline: [
    { date: "2025-10-06", photoCount: 5 },
    { date: "2025-10-27", photoCount: 155 }  // Major work session
  ]
}
```

**From Visual Analysis:**
```typescript
{
  workEnvironment: "home_garage",
  weatherConditions: ["indoor", "good lighting"],
  toolsVisible: ["floor jack", "socket set", "impact wrench"],
  
  // The 5 W's
  who: ["Owner (DIY setup visible)", "Possibly 1-2 helpers"],
  what: ["Suspension work", "Undercarriage restoration", "Rust treatment"],
  when: "October 27, 2025 (bulk of work), started October 6",
  where: "Home garage, concrete floor, desert location (Nevada/Arizona)",
  why: "Restoration - bringing vehicle back to roadworthy/showroom condition"
}
```

**AI determines:**
- Professional shop vs home garage (tool quality, lift vs jack stands)
- Work quality indicators (clean environment, proper tools, good lighting)
- Project timeline and intensity
- Geographic context (desert = less rust, helps condition assessment)

---

## STEP 4: Value Justification (The WHY)

### Generated Output:

```
PURCHASE FLOOR: $75,000 establishes baseline value.

DOCUMENTED COMPONENTS (8 identified):

- Front Dana 44 Axle Assembly: $450 (Very Good - 8/10)
  Evidence: 12 photos showing front undercarriage
  Dana 44 front axle for 1974 Bronco runs $800-1000 new. This unit shows 
  light surface rust but no structural damage...

- BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A Tires (Set of 4): $280 (Good - 7/10)
  Evidence: 18 photos showing all four corners
  31x10.50R15 tires retail $120-140 each new. These show 60-70% tread...

- Front Coil Spring Suspension: $180 (Excellent - 9/10)
  Evidence: 8 photos showing front suspension
  Aftermarket coil conversion worth $300-400 new. These appear recently 
  installed, no rust...

[... 5 more components ...]

WORK CONTEXT:
- Environment: Home garage (concrete floor, good lighting, proper tools)
- Who: Owner-performed work (DIY setup, methodical photo documentation)
- What: Suspension restoration, rust treatment, undercarriage work
- When: October 6-27, 2025 (3-week project, 155 photos in final session)
- Where: Desert location (Nevada/Arizona based on GPS), home garage
- Why: Restoration to bring vehicle to excellent driving/show condition

TOTAL VALUE: $76,360
($75,000 purchase + $1,360 documented components)

Market reference: $48,333 (based on 12 comparable sales)
Position: 58% above market average

EXPLANATION: This valuation is above market because:
1. Purchase established $75k floor (owner's investment)
2. Documented restoration work adds measurable value
3. Photo evidence shows quality workmanship
4. Desert location = less rust = premium condition
5. Comprehensive documentation increases buyer confidence
```

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE vehicle_valuations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  vehicle_id UUID,
  estimated_value NUMERIC,
  documented_components NUMERIC,
  confidence_score INTEGER,
  components JSONB,              -- Full component breakdown
  environmental_context JSONB,   -- 5 W's data
  value_justification TEXT,      -- The WHY explanation
  methodology TEXT,
  valuation_date TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

## How It Improves Over Generic Tags

### Before (Current Broken System):
```
Tag: "Wheel"
Metadata: {}
Value extracted: $0
```

### After (Expert Agent):
```
Component: "BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A 31x10.50R15 (Set of 4)"
Condition: 7/10 (Good)
Value: $280 (60-70% tread, $120 new each)
Evidence: 18 photos showing all corners
Reasoning: "Tires show even wear, good tread depth, no sidewall cracking. 
           Market value for used set in this condition: $250-300"
```

**Difference:** 
- Generic label ‚Üí Specific identification
- No metadata ‚Üí Complete enrichment
- No value ‚Üí Dollar amount with reasoning
- No evidence ‚Üí Photo proof linked

---

## Auto-Enrichment Strategy

### When to Run Expert Agent:

1. **On vehicle creation** - Initial baseline valuation
2. **After bulk photo upload** - When 10+ photos added in session
3. **On owner request** - Manual trigger from UI
4. **Scheduled** - Re-assess monthly for market changes

### Cost Management:

- **Samples images** (every 5th, max 30) - $0.50-1.50 per run
- **Caches literature** - Research Y/M/M once, reuse for all vehicles
- **Batches processing** - Don't run for every single photo

---

## Integration Points

### Frontend Trigger:
```typescript
// After uploading batch of photos
await supabase.functions.invoke('vehicle-expert-agent', {
  body: { vehicleId }
});

// Show: "AI Expert analyzing your photos... this may take 30-60 seconds"
// Then reload valuation to show enriched data
```

### Valuation Display:
```typescript
// valuationEngine.ts now reads from vehicle_valuations table
const { data: expertValuation } = await supabase
  .from('vehicle_valuations')
  .select('*')
  .eq('vehicle_id', vehicleId)
  .order('valuation_date', { ascending: false })
  .limit(1)
  .single();

// Use expert's component breakdown instead of trying to parse tags
```
