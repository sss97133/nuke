📱 HOW A USER AUCTIONS THEIR VEHICLE

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: SELLER LISTS VEHICLE FOR TRADING
  User navigates to their vehicle page
  └─ Clicks "Start Trading" button (in VehicleProfile)
     └─ System creates vehicle_offerings record
        └─ 1,000 shares created @ $100/share
           └─ Seller automatically owns all 1,000 shares

STEP 2: OPENING AUCTION - 9:30am
  System runs price discovery
  └─ Collects all overnight pre-market orders
     └─ Matches buyers and sellers
        └─ Finds equilibrium price (e.g., $98)
           └─ Opening price set: $98/share
              └─ Seller receives $98,000 worth of orders
                 (700 shares sold, 300 shares remaining)

STEP 3: INTRADAY TRADING - All Day
  Users place buy/sell orders throughout the day
  └─ Each order matches against the order book
     └─ Price fluctuates based on supply/demand
        └─ Seller can watch their car value change in real-time!
           └─ Real-time notifications: "Your car +$500 in value!"

STEP 4: CLOSING AUCTION - 4:00pm
  System runs closing price discovery
  └─ Final equilibrium price set (e.g., $105)
     └─ All remaining open orders matched
        └─ Market freezes until next day

STEP 5: SELLER BENEFITS
  ✓ Sold fractional shares for cash/tokens
  ✓ Kept remaining shares in their portfolio
  ✓ Can track value appreciation in real-time
  ✓ Earned reputation as vehicle owner
  ✓ Received 2% commissions from trades

EXAMPLE: 1974 Blazer Daily Summary
  Starting value: 1,000 shares × $100 = $100,000
  Sold at open: 300 shares × $98 = $29,400 (- $600 commission)
  Remaining: 700 shares × $105 (closing) = $73,500
  Day's net: Starting $100k → Ending $102,900 (+2.9%)
  🎉 Seller made $2,900 and still owns the vehicle (via 700 shares)!
