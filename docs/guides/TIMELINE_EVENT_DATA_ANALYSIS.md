# Timeline Event Data Analysis

## Current Timeline Event Structure

### Existing Features
- Basic event classification (type, category)
- Event details (title, description, date, mileage, location)
- Source tracking (user_input, service_record, etc.)
- Confidence scoring and verification
- Cost tracking (receipt_amount, currency)
- Impact flags (affects_value, affects_safety, affects_performance)
- Flexible metadata JSONB field

### Critical Gaps for Project Management

#### Work Session Details
- Labor hours, technician names, skill level required
- Work complexity rating, difficulty assessment
- Tools/equipment used, shop conditions
- Before/during/after photo requirements

#### Parts & Materials Tracking
- Detailed parts catalog (part numbers, suppliers, costs)
- Material quality grades, OEM vs aftermarket
- Parts warranty information, installation notes
- Parts sourcing difficulty, availability

#### Professional Documentation
- Diagnostic findings, test results, measurements
- Professional recommendations, follow-up needs
- Quality control checklists, inspection results
- Client communication logs, approval checkpoints

#### Business Intelligence
- Project profitability, efficiency metrics
- Client satisfaction scores, feedback
- Learning outcomes, skill development
- Process improvements, best practices

## Enhanced Timeline Event Schema

### Core Event Data (Existing)
```sql
event_type, event_category, title, description, event_date,
mileage_at_event, location, receipt_amount, metadata
```

### Work Session Data
```sql
-- Labor tracking
labor_hours DECIMAL(5,2),
labor_rate DECIMAL(10,2),
technician_level TEXT CHECK (technician_level IN ('apprentice', 'journeyman', 'master', 'expert')),
work_complexity INTEGER CHECK (work_complexity >= 1 AND work_complexity <= 10),
tools_required TEXT[],
shop_conditions TEXT,

-- Quality control
quality_checklist JSONB, -- Structured checklist completion
inspection_results JSONB, -- Test results, measurements
diagnostic_codes TEXT[], -- OBD codes, error codes
before_after_photos JSONB, -- Required photo documentation
```

### Parts & Materials Data
```sql
-- Parts tracking
parts_used JSONB[], -- Detailed parts with numbers, costs, suppliers
materials_used JSONB[], -- Fluids, consumables, chemicals
oem_vs_aftermarket TEXT CHECK (oem_vs_aftermarket IN ('oem', 'aftermarket', 'rebuilt', 'used')),
parts_warranty_months INTEGER,
supplier_info JSONB,
parts_difficulty_rating INTEGER CHECK (parts_difficulty_rating >= 1 AND parts_difficulty_rating <= 10),
```

### Professional Documentation
```sql
-- Professional insights
diagnostic_findings TEXT,
professional_recommendations TEXT,
follow_up_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
follow_up_date DATE,
follow_up_mileage INTEGER,
client_education_provided TEXT,
safety_concerns TEXT,
performance_impact_notes TEXT,
```

### Business Intelligence
```sql
-- Project metrics
estimated_vs_actual_hours DECIMAL(5,2),
client_satisfaction_rating INTEGER CHECK (client_satisfaction_rating >= 1 AND client_satisfaction_rating <= 5),
project_profitability DECIMAL(10,2),
efficiency_score INTEGER CHECK (efficiency_score >= 1 AND efficiency_score <= 100),
learning_outcomes TEXT,
process_improvements TEXT,
would_recommend_parts BOOLEAN,
would_recommend_process BOOLEAN,
```

## Enhanced Timeline Event Forms

### Basic Event Form (Current)
- Event type, date, basic description
- Quick image upload
- Minimal friction for rapid documentation

### Professional Work Session Form
- Pre-work: Diagnostic assessment, estimated time/cost
- During work: Live updates, photo documentation, parts used
- Post-work: Quality checklist, client approval, recommendations

### Maintenance Record Form
- Service details: What was done, parts replaced, fluids changed
- Professional insights: Findings, recommendations, future needs
- Documentation: Receipts, photos, test results

### Modification Documentation Form
- Modification details: Parts installed, performance impact
- Professional assessment: Installation quality, compatibility
- Performance data: Before/after measurements, dyno results

### AI-Assisted Data Extraction
- Receipt scanning: Extract parts, costs, labor automatically
- Photo analysis: Identify work performed, quality assessment
- Document parsing: Service records, inspection reports

## Form Design Principles

### Progressive Disclosure
```
Quick Entry → Basic Details → Professional Details → Advanced Analytics
```

### Context-Aware Forms
- Owner uploading: Simple description + photos
- Professional working: Detailed technical forms
- AI processing: Automatic data extraction + human verification

### Smart Defaults
- Pre-fill based on vehicle history
- Suggest parts based on mileage/age
- Recommend follow-up based on work performed

## Data Pipeline Flow

```
Image Upload → AI Analysis → Timeline Event Creation →
Professional Enhancement → Client Approval → Analytics Pipeline →
Project Management Insights
```

### Pipeline Stages
1. Data Capture: Photos, receipts, user input
2. AI Enhancement: Extract structured data from images
3. Professional Validation: Expert review and enhancement
4. Client Verification: Owner approval and feedback
5. Analytics Processing: Generate insights and recommendations

This creates a comprehensive data ecosystem where every timeline event becomes a rich source of project management intelligence.
