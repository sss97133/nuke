PART 1: INSTAGRAM GRAPH API PERMISSIONS
========================================

Permission: instagram_manage_insights

USE CASE DESCRIPTION (Copy this exactly):
--------------------------------------------------------
Our platform connects automotive enthusiasts with their vehicles through Instagram integration. When users connect their Instagram Business accounts, we:

1. Sync their Instagram posts containing vehicle images
2. Use AI to detect vehicles in images and automatically link posts to vehicle profiles
3. Extract location data from posts for geo-tagging (e.g., "show all red cars in Las Vegas")
4. Analyze engagement metrics to identify high-quality automotive content creators
5. Monitor comments to detect vehicle mentions and help users connect their social activity with their vehicle collections

Example: A user posts an image of their Ferrari at a car show in Las Vegas. Our system:
- Detects it's a Ferrari from the image
- Extracts location "Las Vegas" from post metadata
- Links the post to their Ferrari vehicle profile
- Analyzes engagement to rank them as a quality creator
--------------------------------------------------------

DATA USAGE DESCRIPTION (Copy this exactly):
--------------------------------------------------------
- Instagram post data (images, captions, location): Stored to link posts with vehicle profiles
- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, reach): Used to identify high-quality accounts and rank content creators
- Comment data: Analyzed to detect vehicle mentions and help users connect their social activity
- Location data: Extracted for geo-tagging functionality (e.g., "red cars in Las Vegas")
- Account metadata: Stored to maintain connection between Instagram accounts and vehicle profiles

We do NOT:
- Sell user data
- Use data for advertising targeting
- Share data with third parties

Permission: instagram_manage_comments

USE CASE DESCRIPTION (Copy this exactly):
--------------------------------------------------------
We monitor comments on Instagram posts to detect vehicle mentions (make, model, year) and help users link their Instagram activity to vehicle profiles in our system.

When a user comments on a vehicle-related post mentioning a specific car (e.g., "This Ferrari is beautiful!"), our system analyzes the comment text to identify vehicle references and suggests connecting the post to the appropriate vehicle profile.
--------------------------------------------------------

DATA USAGE DESCRIPTION (Copy this exactly):
--------------------------------------------------------
- Comment text: Analyzed to detect vehicle mentions (make, model, year) using natural language processing
- Comment metadata: Stored temporarily to identify vehicle-related discussions
- We use this data solely to help users connect their Instagram activity with their vehicle profiles
- Comments are not shared with third parties or used for advertising
--------------------------------------------------------

USE CASE DESCRIPTION (Copy this exactly):
--------------------------------------------------------
We use the user's current city location to pre-fill location data when they're creating vehicle profiles or searching for vehicles. This enhances the geo-tagging and location-based filtering features.

For example, if a user's Facebook profile shows they're located in Las Vegas, when they search for "red cars" on our platform, we can automatically filter results to show red cars in Las Vegas.
--------------------------------------------------------
