## Troubleshooting

### Stripe Not Loading
```typescript
// Check environment variable
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY);

// Should start with pk_test_ or pk_live_
```

### Edge Functions Failing
```bash
# Check deployment
supabase functions list

# View logs
supabase functions logs setup-payment-method
```

### Deposit Not Releasing
```sql
-- Check bid status
SELECT * FROM auction_bids 
WHERE id = 'bid-id';

-- Check payment transactions
SELECT * FROM payment_transactions
WHERE bid_id = 'bid-id';

-- Manually release if needed (in Stripe dashboard)
```
