## Next Steps

From our founder's perspective, the most critical next steps are:

> "My most critical next step is being able to properly communicate with AI to simply build a rough functioning production deployment. My critical next move is to get it up and running so that I can simply send people links. I can simply ask investors to start inputting their vehicle already. If I can just generate users that I know personally, I would have a beautiful portfolio of users."

This initial focus on deploying a basic working product and getting early adoption from the founder's network will be key to demonstrating the concept and gathering feedback.

## Resource Requirements

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Cloud Services:** AWS or Azure for core services
- **Database:** Supabase for real-time database and authentication
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum/Polygon for investment system
- **Storage:** Scalable solution for video and image data
- **Hosting:** Vercel for frontend deployment

### Personnel

As described by our founder:

> "Funding and access to tech that'll actually work and being able to quickly scale the real estate side - setting up a bunch of PTZ shops, say 100 different PTZ shops throughout the United States so that upon rollout people can instantly take their vehicles and start getting the appraisals going."

Key partnerships needed:
- Hardware providers (Panasonic, Sony, Canon, Black Magic)
- Database and IT installers
- AV installers
- Construction experts
- Real estate investors

### Physical Infrastructure
- **PTZ Centers:** Initially 1-2 pilot locations, expanding to major markets
- **Equipment:** High-quality camera systems, computer hardware, networking
- **Real Estate:** Appropriate spaces for vehicle verification centers

## Market Strategy

### Initial Target Market

Our founder has identified the digital aspects as the most immediate focus:

> "The market segment I am most interested in is digital - that's the only thing I can tackle on my own. Digital tools is my first market segment and that represents for me high popularity, intrinsic value classic cars, the resurgence of classic vehicles, the popular vehicles, the fun stuff."

The strategy is to focus first on professionals in the industry:

> "By providing the highest quality tools for professionals is my key goal, because once professionals adopt it and they see the value proposition, I think more people follow because it has that elevated quality that it's been vetted by the professionals in the industry."

Collectors are seen as another promising early adopter segment:

> "Collectors is a fun market because the tool becomes very useful for people who have multiple vehicles. Their profiles would look beautiful because they'd obviously have a large collection of vehicles and they'd want to have the vehicles verified."

### Geographic Focus

Initial geographic focus will be on major cities:

> "For geographic regions, I would start in big cities. I'm based in Las Vegas so I think the first PTZ shop should be in Vegas. It's kind of a cool spot because there's so much happening here, there's a lot of special vehicles that pass through."

Other initial target cities include:
- Los Angeles
- Phoenix
- San Francisco
- New York
- Miami

## Long-term Vision

The long-term vision involves creating a network of verification centers and storage facilities that serve as cultural hubs:

> "I would like to have the central hubs that are like mass vehicle storage that are very similar to in the art world what's called a free port. I think it's just cool styling for the more high-end collectors and I would love that very large Freeport would be installed in big cities."

These centers would grow organically through user demand:

> "If there's not enough storage space then they can start crowdfunding or petitioning for a second storage expansion that way that naturally grows on its own and incentivizes people."

## Success Metrics

To measure the success of the platform, we'll look for:

> "A massive rate of adoption, a massive growth of users, a massive influx of vehicle profiles, and then once we hit a certain critical mass, we'll start seeing the next iteration of people's career developing and we'll see sponsorships reaching out."

Other metrics will include:
- User growth rate
- Vehicle profiles created
- Verification center usage
- Transaction volume
- Investment activity
- Professional profile creation

## Funding Strategy

The platform will require significant funding for both the digital platform and physical infrastructure. Our approach will be:

1. **Initial MVP Development**: Bootstrap or seed funding to create core digital platform
2. **Early Traction Demonstration**: Show user adoption and vehicle profiles
3. **Series A Funding**: For initial PTZ infrastructure and blockchain integration
4. **Strategic Partnerships**: Work with established industry players for scaling

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path forward for Nuke's development, focusing first on the digital foundations before expanding into physical verification and economic models. By executing on this plan, we can create the revolutionary platform our founder envisions - one that transforms how vehicles are documented, verified, and valued in the digital age.
