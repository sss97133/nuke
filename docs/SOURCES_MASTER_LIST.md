## Master list: online automotive sources (seed list)

This is a human-readable view of the canonical registry at `data/sources/master_sources.yaml`.

Rules:
- This list is a starting point. Expand continuously.
- Do not build extraction until access/compliance constraints are understood and documented.
- Prefer compliant access (public pages, partnerships, official APIs) over fragile or high-risk scraping.

### Auctions (collector, enthusiast, salvage, wholesale)

- Bring a Trailer (`bringatrailer.com`)
- Cars and Bids (`carsandbids.com`)
- Hemmings Auctions (`hemmings.com/auctions`)

### Dealer website platforms (platform adapters)

These are “platform families” that power many dealer sites; we should build adapters by platform:

- Dealer Inspire (`dealerinspire.com`)

  - O'Reilly (`oreillyauto.com`)
  - AutoZone (`autozone.com`)

### Next expansion targets (to add to the YAML registry)

- More enthusiast auctions (regional + niche)
- More wholesale/dealer auctions and feeds (partnership-first)
- More dealer platforms (identify top platform families by market share)
- Specialty suppliers (off-road, restoration, classic truck parts, performance)
- International marketplaces (EU/UK/CA/AU) by priority
