## Technical Implementation

### **Phase 1: Enhanced URL Import for Business Context**

When importing vehicles via URL, the system now:

1. **Detects Source**: Supports BAT, Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, AutoTrader, Cars.com
2. **Sets Relationship**: Automatically sets `relationship_type: 'discovered'`
3. **Business Association**: Links to user's business if they have one
4. **Fleet Integration**: Adds to business_vehicle_fleet with appropriate `fleet_role`

### **Phase 2: Acquisition Rating Engine**

Automated assessment using existing vehicle data:

```sql
-- Acquisition Quality Score Calculation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_acquisition_score(vehicle_id UUID, target_budget NUMERIC)
RETURNS JSON AS $$
DECLARE
    vehicle_data RECORD;
    score_breakdown JSON;
    overall_score INTEGER;
BEGIN
    SELECT * INTO vehicle_data FROM vehicles WHERE id = vehicle_id;

    -- Price Analysis (30% weight)
    price_score := CASE
        WHEN vehicle_data.asking_price <= target_budget * 0.8 THEN 100
        WHEN vehicle_data.asking_price <= target_budget THEN 80
        WHEN vehicle_data.asking_price <= target_budget * 1.2 THEN 60
        ELSE 30
    END;

    -- Market Data Analysis (25% weight)
    market_score := calculate_market_position(vehicle_data.make, vehicle_data.model, vehicle_data.year);

    -- Condition Assessment (20% weight)
    condition_score := COALESCE(vehicle_data.condition_rating * 10, 70);

    -- Documentation Quality (15% weight)
    doc_score := calculate_documentation_score(vehicle_id);

    -- Opportunity Score (10% weight)
    opportunity_score := calculate_opportunity_score(vehicle_data);

    overall_score := (price_score * 0.3 + market_score * 0.25 + condition_score * 0.2 +
                     doc_score * 0.15 + opportunity_score * 0.1)::INTEGER;

    RETURN json_build_object(
        'overall_score', overall_score,
        'price_score', price_score,
        'market_score', market_score,
        'condition_score', condition_score,
        'documentation_score', doc_score,
        'opportunity_score', opportunity_score,
        'recommendation', get_acquisition_recommendation(overall_score)
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
