# Auction Market Engine - Complete Implementation Guide

**Status**: PRODUCTION READY | October 20, 2025

## Overview

The Nuke Auction Market Engine implements cutting-edge stock exchange mechanics for fractional vehicle ownership. Users buy/sell shares of vehicles in real-time with NYSE-style opening/closing auctions and FOMO-driven mobile experiences.

---

## Architecture

### Three Core Systems

**1. Order Matching Engine**
- Real-time buy/sell order matching
- Continuous intraday trading (market orders)
- Automatic price discovery
- Market impact calculations

**2. Auction System**
- Opening auction (9:30am ET)
- Closing auction (4:00pm ET)  
- Double-auction price discovery mechanism
- Flexible scheduling per vehicle

**3. Gamification Layer**
- Daily leaderboards (ranked by P&L)
- Portfolio tracking (real-time valuations)
- FOMO notifications ("You're up $50 today!")
- Winning streaks and badges

## Order Matching Algorithm

### Continuous Trading (Market Hours)

When user places order:

```
1. Fetch opposite side of order book (sell orders if buying, buy orders if selling)
2. Sort by price (buyers want lowest, sellers want highest)
3. Match against opposite orders:
   - Price must cross: bid >= ask
   - Share quantity: min(buyer_requested, seller_available)
   - Trade price: take passive side's price (aggressive order takes worst price)
   - Commission: 2% goes to Nuke
4. Update both orders (filled/partially filled)
5. Record trade in market_trades table
6. Update offering market data (bid/ask spreads)
7. Send notifications to traders
```

### Example: Buyer Aggressive

```
Order Book BEFORE:
  Sellers: $110 (100 shares), $112 (50 shares)
  Buyers:  $105 (200 shares)

New Buyer: 150 shares @ $112

Matching:
  1. Match 100 shares with $110 seller → Trade @ $110
  2. Match 50 shares with $112 seller → Trade @ $112
  → Average fill price: $110.67

Result:
  - Buyer: 150 shares @ avg $110.67
  - Sellers executed at their prices
  - 50 shares still bid at $105 (unfilled)
```

## Price Discovery: Double Auction

Runs at market open (9:30am) and close (4:00pm ET).

```typescript
Function: executePriceDiscovery()

Input:
  - All active buy orders sorted by price DESC: [$115, $110, $105, $100]
  - All active sell orders sorted by price ASC: [$108, $112, $116, $120]

Process:
  1. Find equilibrium where bids cross asks:
     Bid $115 >= Ask $108 ✓ (MATCH)
     Bid $110 >= Ask $112 ✗ (STOP)
     
  2. Equilibrium price = $108 (lowest ask that clears)
  
  3. Execute ALL orders at $108:
     - 3 buyers get 150 shares @ $108
     - 1 seller gets $108 per share
     
  4. Record price discovery event
  
  5. Update offering.current_share_price = $108

Output:
  - Orders matched: 2 buy orders, 1 sell order
  - Volume: 150 shares
  - Price set for day
```

---

## Market Impact Model

Before placing large orders, show user:

```
Order: Buy 100 shares (10% of total)
Initial Price: $100
Impact Factor: 10% × 5% = 0.5% price movement
Price After Order: $100 + ($100 × 0.5%) = $100.50
Impact Cost: $0.50 per share
User's Average Fill: ~$100.75 (splits the impact)
```

Larger orders = bigger price moves = more visible trader activity = FOMO.

## Data Flow Example

### Trade Execution (Real-Time)

```
User clicks "Buy 5 shares of 1974 Blazer at $110"
  ↓
Order inserted into market_orders table
  ↓
System checks opposite book (sellers @ $110 or lower)
  ↓
Found: Seller willing @ $108
  ↓
Execute trade:
  - buyer_id: user1
  - seller_id: user2
  - shares: 5
  - price: $108 (passive side's price)
  - commission: 5 × $108 × 2% = $10.80
  ↓
Create market_trade record
  ↓
Update share_holdings:
  - user1: +5 shares (entry_price = $108)
  - user2: -5 shares
  ↓
Update vehicle_offerings:
  - current_share_price = $108
  - bid_ask_spread updated
  ↓
Send notifications:
  - user1: "✅ Bought 5 shares at $108"
  - user2: "✅ Sold 5 shares at $108"
  - leaderboard: user1 now up $50 today
  ↓
Broadcast to all subscribers via WebSocket
  ↓
Mobile apps update in real-time
```
