## What Shipped

### Mobile Lightbox Toolbar Redesign
Complete overhaul of the image lightbox mobile interface - went from cluttered 3-row toolbar to clean single-row design.

---

## Before → After

### BEFORE (Terrible):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [✕]    May 17, 2022       [INFO]  │  ← 35px
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         [←]      [→]               │  ← 45px
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [TAG] [PRIMARY] [ROTATE] [BLUR]  │  ← 40px
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
TOTAL: ~120px of chrome
```

### AFTER (Clean):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✕   1 of 15 • SWIPE TO NAVIGATE  ⋮ │  ← 35px
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
TOTAL: ~35px of chrome
```

**Result**: 85px more screen space for the actual image (70% reduction in chrome)

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Single-Row Mobile Toolbar ✅
- **Left**: Close button (✕)
- **Center**: Image counter + "SWIPE TO NAVIGATE" hint
- **Right**: Menu button (⋮)
- Black background, minimal, clean

### 2. Actions Moved to Sidebar ✅
- Click menu (⋮) opens sidebar
- Sidebar defaults to ACTIONS tab (on mobile when canEdit)
- Full-width buttons with proper touch targets:
  - TAG IMAGE
  - SET AS PRIMARY (✓ when already primary)
  - ROTATE 90°
  - MARK AS SENSITIVE (✓ when already sensitive)
  - DELETE IMAGE (red, separated)

### 3. Navigation via Swipe ✅
- Already implemented touch handlers (working)
- No need for arrow buttons eating space
- Natural mobile UX

### 4. Desktop Unchanged ✅
- Desktop keeps horizontal toolbar
- No regression for desktop users
- Responsive: `block sm:hidden` vs `hidden sm:flex`
