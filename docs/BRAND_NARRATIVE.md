# Nuke: Brand Narrative Guide

## Core Brand Story

**Every vehicle tells a story.**

Classic cars that witnessed history. Family vehicles that carried generations of memories. Race cars that pushed boundaries. Work trucks that built communities. Each with its own journey, its own soul—yet these stories are scattered, fragmented, or lost entirely.

Nuke exists to give vehicles their voice—creating a digital identity that persists throughout each vehicle's lifetime. We're not just a platform; we're the custodians of automotive legacy, the guardians of vehicular truth, and the architects of a new relationship between humans and their machines.

## Brand Purpose

**We exist to transform vehicles from temporary possessions into enduring digital entities with their own identity, history, and community.**

In concrete terms:
- We create comprehensive digital profiles for every vehicle
- We verify automotive history through multiple authenticated sources
- We enable new forms of ownership, investment, and appreciation
- We recognize and elevate the craftspeople who maintain automotive heritage
- We build physical and digital spaces that celebrate vehicle culture

## Brand Positioning

**Nuke is the definitive platform for vehicle identity, authentication, and community.**

Unlike traditional vehicle history reports, marketplace listings, or documentation tools that focus narrowly on transactions, Nuke treats the vehicle itself as the centerpiece of an entire ecosystem. We're building a platform where vehicles have their own persistent digital soul that endures from creation to legacy.

### Category Disruption

> "I see this as a massive disruption market for the future of auctions because it's obvious to me that all future auctions should go through this platform because the traditional auction platforms like Barrett Jackson just can't hold a candle to the vehicle history that this platform can provide."
