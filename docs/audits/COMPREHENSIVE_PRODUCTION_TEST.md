   - Grille: 50%, 65% (center)
❓ Does tooltip show on hover?
❓ Does spatial popup open on click?
❓ Do suppliers display correctly?
❓ Does checkout modal work?
```

### **Console Tests (Need Manual Browser Check):**
```
❓ Does "🔍 TAG DEBUG:" appear in console?
❓ What are the actual numbers?
   - totalTags: ?
   - visibleTags: ?
   - spatialTags: ?
❓ Any JavaScript errors?
```

## ❌ **WHAT'S UNVERIFIED (Need Browser):**

### **Frontend Rendering:**
```
❌ Can't verify lightbox opens
❌ Can't verify green dots render
❌ Can't verify spatial popup works
❌ Can't verify console debug output
❌ Can't capture screenshots
```

**Reason:** Playwright browser automation tools not available

- ✅ Database has perfect data
- ✅ All backend logic working
- ✅ Edge functions active

**What You Need to Verify:**
- Open browser to: https://n-zero.dev/vehicle/a90c008a-3379-41d8-9eb2-b4eda365d74c
- Open console: Cmd+Option+J
- Click image
- Check for: "🔍 TAG DEBUG:"

## 🚀 **CONCLUSION:**

**Backend:** 100% verified and working ✅  
**Deployment:** 100% verified (latest bundle live) ✅  
**Frontend Rendering:** Requires manual browser check ❓  

**The system is deployed. We just need your eyes to verify the UI is rendering correctly.**

## 🔧 **WORKAROUND FOR SCREENSHOT:**

Since Playwright isn't available, you can:

**Option 1:** Open browser manually and send me the console numbers
**Option 2:** Use browser DevTools screenshot (Cmd+Shift+P → "screenshot")
**Option 3:** Just tell me: "Lightbox opened: Yes/No, Green dots: Yes/No"

That's all I need to complete the debugging! 🔍
