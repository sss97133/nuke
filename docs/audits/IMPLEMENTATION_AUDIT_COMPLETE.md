## PHASE 2: CREDENTIALS & ENVIRONMENT SETUP ⚠ REVIEW NEEDED

### 2.1 Required Environment Variables

**Status:** `.env.local` NOT FOUND - Using `env.example` as template

**Required Keys (MUST SET):**
```env
# CRITICAL - Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# API Configuration  
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
VITE_PHOENIX_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api

# Third Party Services
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-secret

# Backend (if using Phoenix API)
SECRET_KEY_BASE=your-phoenix-secret-key-base
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
PHX_HOST=localhost
PORT=4000

# CORS
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174
```

**Recommendation:** 
1. Create `.env.local` with actual keys before deployment
2. Verify each key is valid by testing connections
3. Set production values in deployment platform

### 2.2 Supabase Configuration - STATUS: ⚠ VERIFY

**Auth Providers:** Check in Supabase dashboard:
- [ ] Email authentication enabled
- [ ] Google OAuth configured
- [ ] GitHub OAuth configured  
- [ ] CORS settings allow frontend domain
- [ ] Realtime subscriptions enabled (for vehicle updates)

**Storage Buckets:** 
- [ ] `vehicles` bucket exists with proper policies
- [ ] `images` bucket exists with proper policies
- [ ] Read/write permissions configured for authenticated users
