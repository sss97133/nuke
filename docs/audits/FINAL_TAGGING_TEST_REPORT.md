# 🧪 Final Tagging System Test Report

**Date:** October 26, 2025 3:42 AM  
**Fix Deployed:** Parts marketplace fields now mapped in Tag interface

---

## 🔧 **THE FIX:**

### **Problem:**
`TagService.normalizeTagFromDB()` didn't map new database columns:
- `is_shoppable`
- `suppliers` (JSON array)
- `oem_part_number`
- `lowest_price_cents`
- All other parts marketplace fields

### **Solution:**
1. Updated `Tag` interface to include all 14 new parts marketplace fields
2. Updated `normalizeTagFromDB()` to map them from database
3. Deployed to production

---

## 📋 **TEST PLAN:**

1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Click vehicle image to open lightbox
3. Confirm tags load with marketplace data
4. Click spatial dot
5. **Expected:** Spatial popup appears with part info + pricing
6. Double-tap supplier
7. **Expected:** Checkout modal opens
8. Test on-demand part ID (click blank area)
9. **Expected:** AI identifies part → creates tag → shows popup

---

## 📊 **EXPECTED CONSOLE:**

```
✅ Loaded 3 tags for image 59fec501...
🔍 TAG DEBUG: {totalTags: 3, visibleTags: 3, spatialTags: 3}
🔍 Tag clicked: Front Bumper Assembly shoppable: true suppliers: 3
🔍 Popup state set to true
✅ SpatialPartPopup rendering with suppliers: [LMC Truck, RockAuto, Amazon]
```

**If popup STILL doesn't appear, next debug step:** Check `SpatialPartPopup` component for render conditions.
