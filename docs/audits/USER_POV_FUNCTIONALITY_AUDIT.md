## üìä **SUMMARY:**

**Current State:** The site has a solid foundation with working navigation, vehicle listing, and data display, but critical visual and interactive features are broken due to deployment issues.

**Main Problem:** Vercel CDN is serving old code (`BB5HYU31.js`) instead of the new bundle with spatial parts marketplace features.

**Solution:** Force deployment to update the bundle, then debug any remaining image loading and lightbox issues.

**User Impact:** Users can browse vehicles by text but cannot see photos or use interactive features, significantly reducing the site's value proposition.

**Timeline to Fix:** 2-4 hours to restore full functionality.
