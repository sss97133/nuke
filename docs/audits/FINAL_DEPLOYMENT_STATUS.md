## ⏳ **CURRENT ISSUE:**

**n-zero.dev still showing OLD bundle:**
- Bundle hash: `index-BB5HYU31.js` (OLD)
- Lightbox loads **3 tags** (console confirms: "✅ Loaded 3 tags")
- But no green dots visible (old code doesn't have SpatialTagMarker)

**Why:**
- Custom domain (n-zero.dev) takes longer to propagate
- Vercel CDN caching
- Need to wait 5-15 minutes OR
- Configure Vercel to auto-promote production deployment

---

## 🎯 **TO SEE IT WORK RIGHT NOW:**

### **Option 1: Wait for n-zero.dev to update (5-15 min)**

Check bundle hash:
```javascript
// In browser console:
document.querySelector('script[src*="index-"]').src
```

When it changes from `BB5HYU31` to a new hash → **GREEN DOTS WILL APPEAR**

### **Option 2: Check Vercel Dashboard**

1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find "nuke_frontend" project
3. Click latest deployment
4. Should show: "Production" with new build time
5. If not promoted: Click "Promote to Production"

### **Option 3: Force Production Alias**

```bash
cd /Users/skylar/nuke/nuke_frontend
vercel alias set nukefrontend-lu5oxm5ji-nzero.vercel.app n-zero.dev
```

## 📊 **VERIFY IN DATABASE:**

### **Check if tags loaded:**
```sql
SELECT 
  tag_name,
  oem_part_number,
  is_shoppable,
  lowest_price_cents / 100.0 AS price,
  x_position,
  y_position
FROM image_tags
WHERE image_id = '59fec501-534d-4420-8c31-fb277c839959';
```

**Expected:** 3 rows with shoppable = true

### **Check suppliers:**
```sql
SELECT supplier_name, supplier_url 
FROM part_suppliers 
ORDER BY supplier_name;
```

**Expected:** 5 rows (Amazon, Classic Parts, LMC Truck, RockAuto, Summit Racing)

### **Check if order was created (after test purchase):**
```sql
SELECT 
  part_name,
  total_cents / 100.0 AS total,
  payment_status
FROM part_purchases
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected:** 1 row with your test order
