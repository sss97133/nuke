**Results:**
- ✅ Comment System: Found and working

## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Document OCR:** Requires OpenAI API key in Supabase Edge Function
   - If not configured, document uploads still work
   - Just won't auto-extract data
   - Manual title/notes entry works fine

2. **Owner Buttons:** Only show if you're the vehicle owner
   - Correct behavior (security)
   - Upload Doc, Edit Price, Edit Data require ownership

3. **AI Insights:** Only show on events with `cost_amount` or `duration_hours`
   - If timeline events don't have this data, badges won't appear
   - This is data-dependent, not a bug

4. **Org Switcher:** Only shows if user is member of at least 1 organization
   - If you're not in any orgs, it won't appear
   - Visit /shops/new to create one
