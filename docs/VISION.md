# Nuke: Vision and Market Strategy

## The Digital Soul of Vehicles

Nuke is fundamentally reimagining the relationship between vehicles and the digital world. We're creating a platform where every vehicle has its own digital identity - a comprehensive profile that serves as the definitive record of its existence, history, and value.

## Core Vision

### Vehicles as Digital Entities

At the center of our vision is treating vehicles not just as physical assets, but as entities with their own digital identity:

- Each vehicle maintains a comprehensive profile encompassing its entire history
- Multiple validated data sources contribute to this profile
- The vehicle's digital identity persists regardless of ownership changes
- The platform becomes the steward of the vehicle's "digital soul" throughout its lifetime

### Revolutionizing Ownership Models

Nuke transforms how vehicles are owned, valued, and invested in:

- Traditional ownership (title holders) remains the foundation
- New models enable fractional investment in vehicles
- Creation of speculative markets around vehicle restoration and value
- Development of vehicle-specific investment opportunities
- Crowdsourced funding for restoration and maintenance

### Verified Data as the Foundation

Our platform's value is built on validated, verified data:

- Multiple sources of truth for each vehicle
- Video verification of work performed
