# What We Need Funding For

## The 30-Second Answer

We've built the infrastructure to aggregate vehicle data from 44+ sources. Now we need to unlock the authoritative sources that make this data institutional-grade.

## Funding Tiers

### $0 (Done)
- 44 auction/forum/social sources integrated
- 136k vehicles, 4.5M data points, 10M images
- Community knowledge Carfax will never have

### $25k - Data Authority
| Item | Cost | Unlocks |
|------|------|---------|
| NMVTIS provider status | $10k | Official title history (Carfax's core) |
| Copart/IAA historical data | $5k | Salvage history at scale |
| NHTSA full integration | $0 | Recalls, specs, safety ratings |
| Infrastructure | $10k | Scale to 1M+ vehicles |

**Outcome:** We match Carfax on official records AND beat them on community knowledge.

### $100k - Market Intelligence
| Item | Cost | Unlocks |
|------|------|---------|
| Insurance data partnership | $50k | Accident claims without police reports |
| State DMV pilots (2 states) | $30k | Direct registration/title data |
| Wholesale auction access | $20k | Real dealer pricing (Manheim) |

**Outcome:** We have data Carfax doesn't. Insurers and dealers come to us.

### $500k - Platform Scale
| Item | Cost | Unlocks |
|------|------|---------|
| 50-state DMV coverage | $200k | Nationwide title authority |
| Insurance industry partnership | $150k | Full claims integration |
| Enterprise sales team | $100k | B2B revenue from dealers/insurers |
| Compliance/legal | $50k | SOC2, data licensing |

**Outcome:** We become the data layer for vehicle transactions.

## Why This Order?

1. **NMVTIS first** — It's what Carfax queries. We need parity before we can sell differentiation.
2. **Salvage second** — High-value signal. "Was this car totaled?" is a $500 question.
3. **Insurance third** — Accident history is the #1 thing buyers want.
4. **DMVs last** — Expensive, slow, but necessary for enterprise.

## What's NOT a Funding Priority

- More engineering (we have 430 edge functions)
- More auctions (we have the major ones)
- Marketing (product sells itself with the right data)

## The Ask

**$25k** gets us to data parity with Carfax.
**$100k** gets us data they can't match.
**$500k** makes us the infrastructure layer.

We're not building a better Carfax. We're building the data layer that makes Carfax obsolete.
