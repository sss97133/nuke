# Founder Q&A: The Vision Behind Nuke

This document captures a comprehensive interview with the founder of Nuke, exploring the vision, strategy, and philosophy behind the platform. The conversation offers valuable insights into how Nuke aims to revolutionize the automotive industry by creating digital identities for vehicles, enabling new forms of ownership, and establishing a verification infrastructure.

## Core Vision and Target Users

**Q: What is the core purpose of the Nuke application, and who are your target users?**

A: My core users are essentially everybody in the automotive industry. While I personally have a broad skillset spanning mechanical work, detailing, paint and body, sales, and digital marketing, my target market extends to every type of car enthusiast and professional in the industry.

This includes mechanics, detailers, car salespeople, car collectors, hobbyists, DIY enthusiasts, and a huge market: car owners themselves. At its core, this software is meant to be the digital mirror and repository for individual vehicles. My target market is ultimately every single vehicle - each vehicle would eventually be represented on this platform, with humans serving as stewards during their defined ownership periods.

There are two key user groups: the vehicles themselves (as the target market in an IoT application) representing the digital soul of the vehicle in our database, and the traditional ownership structures represented by humans who hold the title. In the future, ownership can become multifaceted, creating a system where we maintain traditional forms of ownership while enabling new economic models.

Cars today frequently exceed their market value with their intrinsic value and forecasted value. The ability for a vehicle to monetize itself becomes apparent - for example, a vehicle might be sold multiple times at auction, generating significant fees each time. This represents an opportunity to disrupt auction markets, as our platform can provide richer vehicle history than traditional auction platforms like Barrett Jackson.

Our platform would provide enhanced data analysis through publicly verified data capture: video systems, documentation of restoration and repairs, tracking devices, and engine management systems that record the engine's data. All these data sources would contribute to the vehicle's profile, with data compounding over time - creating the ultimate evolution of vehicle history reporting.

Our goal is to become the ultimate database for all automotive recordkeeping. Our target users become anyone who wants access to that data - primarily benefiting car owners and the people who invest in and support cars and their owners.

## Development Roadmap

**Q: What are the most important next steps for Nuke's development, and what resources would help you move forward?**

A: The next step would be deploying a basic functioning site where all our ideas are implemented in their most basic forms, then gradually rolling out more sophisticated functions while being prepared to scale immediately.

A critical development piece would be building a complete database of all vehicles with VIN numbers. Once we have every VIN, we can start connecting data to them, which helps identify cases where multiple identical VINs appear.

Another important development would be establishing brick-and-mortar physical locations - what I call "PTZ shops" based on the Pivot-Tilt-Zoom cameras I believe would be most appropriate. These would provide live streaming and connect to CNC machines to track technicians who interact with vehicles. This creates verified documentation through video and helps technicians develop their careers through work verification.

This technology is paramount for real-time data acquisition. Anytime a vehicle enters one of these shops, it generates verified documentation. Technicians can choose to be recorded in "ghost mode" or "verified mode," with the latter helping them build their professional reputation.

The only people who don't benefit from this system are dishonest individuals, which is a key selling point. The system elevates anyone who wants to operate at their highest level of expertise - from beginners to advanced professionals.

For partnerships, we need to focus on people closest to the vehicles: owners, technicians, mechanics, service providers, shop owners, and collection owners. We also need technology partners who can help with database management, video capturing, and connecting vehicles with users.

## PTZ Verification Centers

**Q: How do you envision these physical verification centers operating day-to-day? What would the customer experience be like?**

A: A PTZ location has the ability to livestream and record vehicles from multiple angles in real time. Visualize a 30x40 to 60x100 building with automotive lifts, turntables, lighting, and cameras mounted on the walls and ceiling that move in XY coordinates. Cameras would also be connected to the lifts, and technicians might wear livestreaming cameras like GoPros while they work.

This comprehensive coverage captures every angle - even the tools and parts used, which gives advertisers a reason to participate. They'd want access to our data to know that their products are being used in our shops.

These verification centers address a key bottleneck in the automotive aftermarket: when someone decides to sell their vehicle, what do they do? Our solution is to take it to one of these places. It doesn't matter if the car is driven or rolled in - shops will initially be set up to receive functioning vehicles, with specialized locations for non-running vehicles available later.

This becomes the quickest way for someone to maximize the value of their vehicle because it reaches the largest audience. Our platform attracts users because we have what they're looking for - a comprehensive inventory of all vehicles.

The customer experience would be as automated as possible. Ideally, the process would be as close to free as possible to get a vehicle online. We'd have a trained technician at each location who's an expert in running our PTZ appraisal system.

The verification process might take as little as five minutes or as long as a full inspection. The key insight is that the amount of time invested in verification directly increases the vehicle's potential value. A vehicle that reaches 100% verified status has significantly higher value than one with minimal documentation. The consumer experience is as good as what they're willing to invest in terms of time and thoroughness.

## Market Focus and Adoption Strategy

**Q: Which specific segment of the market do you plan to focus on first to gain traction?**

A: My first market segment focus is digital, as that's what I can tackle on my own. This represents high-popularity, intrinsic-value classic cars, resurgence classics, popular vehicles, and fun stuff that people enjoy but hasn't been overvalued yet.

Providing the highest quality tools for professionals is my key goal. Once professionals adopt the platform and see its value, more people will follow because it has that elevated quality that's been vetted by industry experts. By professionals, I mean anyone who's highly efficient and honest in their work.

Collectors are another interesting market because the tool becomes very useful for people with multiple vehicles. Their profiles would look impressive with a large collection of verified vehicles. They might even want their own verification systems installed on their properties and could become franchise operators because they'd see the benefit of running tests and getting early access to vehicles coming through the system.

For collectors, the discovery aspect is paramount - finding new and interesting vehicles. This is addressed in our software through a discovery feature that precedes PTZ verification. Users can upload any bit of information or leads about a vehicle, with more information being better. It's a game of moving from 0% to 100% information for every vehicle in the world.

## Technology Integration

**Q: How do you envision Nuke interfacing with newer vehicles that have built-in telematics versus older classics that might need additional hardware?**

A: New vehicles are actually the easiest to integrate because, as long as there's an agreement with the manufacturer, the connection is already established. Many companies try to keep their vehicle data private, which creates a challenge.

This might be where our platform becomes a disruptive technology that doesn't allow companies to keep vehicle data private, as consumers will demand access to that data. Or it could become the tool that allows consumers to fight against the privatization of data being withheld by large companies.

Even with gated technology or data, it would be as simple as sending a request to the manufacturer, who would either allow access to the data or not. They're already collecting and harvesting significant amounts of data - our platform would push for more consumer access.

## Investment and Ownership Models

**Q: How do you envision the fractional ownership model working in practice? How would returns be distributed?**

A: I'm careful about using terms like "fractional ownership model." I see it more as a separate piggy bank that acquires potential value connected to the vehicle but doesn't become an asset of the vehicle unless there's a contractual agreement between the funding provider and the vehicle owner.

Traditionally with vehicles, when someone provides money, they typically have a lien on the title, which involves significant paperwork. It would be interesting if we could become the bank for vehicles, but more importantly, especially in the classic car industry, vehicles often have untapped value or unrealized gains.

For example, a damaged vehicle might be purchased at a significantly undervalued price. With proper project management, decisions, tools, materials, parts, and technical expertise, a properly restored vehicle can become much more valuable. Creating a market around this concept - where money invested correctly increases a vehicle's value - is an exciting opportunity.

I personally love old pickup trucks and would enjoy diversifying my investment by putting a small amount into many different trucks. I'd be excited to see if that small investment grows substantially over 10-20 years. This approach is similar to predictive markets or blockchain-based investments, representing a long-term value opportunity based in a digital system.

There are many ways to invest in this system. Some people might only want to invest a quarter, while others might want to put in $10,000. Those who invest more would naturally want greater benefits, perhaps requiring a lien on the vehicle, a smart contract, or agreement to have restoration done at a specific shop.

An unbiased AI-powered language model could help certify contracts on a quality scale, helping people quickly understand if they're getting a fair deal. This makes partnerships less risky than the current system because we're using more data to make decisions and making that data publicly visible in a way that's understandable to consumers.

Once a vehicle is fully restored, it can generate money in multiple ways: the owner can use it, take out a new loan that buys out investors, or generate royalties through social media exposure and content creation. Vehicles can participate in sponsored content, with potential revenue sharing between owners and investors.

The same logic applies to users - investors could support professionals in building their careers, similar to how Twitch streamers receive tips and sponsorships. This could extend to shops as well, which could be sponsored or generate revenue for their investors based on their work and advertising.

## Technical Challenges

**Q: What do you see as the biggest technical challenge that needs to be solved first?**

A: My first big technical challenge is getting a data set large enough to begin meaningful analysis and projections. This might sound ridiculous, but it's not much more than a giant CSV file of all cars and their information.

I'm looking to AI for significant help here. My goal is to have enough data to start training language models on my own dataset, videos, and audio. I want to accumulate data from all my PTZ shops, and with funding, we can import manuals and access existing databases to train our models.

The technology largely exists - it's a matter of refining it and putting it to work. I like the example of AWS Recognition software; we could integrate similar technology into our workspace where everything can be identified and monetized.

Creating a prototype version wouldn't be too difficult in my own shop. It only takes about 10,000 parts to build a certain vehicle, so these could be fully documented and linked in what would essentially be a localhost version focused on a small group of vehicles.

The verification process happens in public, so it really depends on users starting to engage with the platform. Car enthusiasts are generally smart and love to provide information to well-organized structures. I believe future users will adopt the system because it addresses their needs.

The blockchain implementation remains a mystery to me, but I recognize its importance and need to find the right people to work with in that area.

## Community Building

**Q: How do you plan to build and nurture this community in the early stages?**

A: I think this comes down to product-market fit. Being already involved in the community makes it easier because I understand their needs. I'm essentially communicating the community's needs to the digital world, saying, "This is the tool we need badly because so many people are getting ripped off."

There's a massive issue with tracking all the data produced during painstaking restoration efforts. As professionals, when we restore cars, we want to keep something tangible from the experience. We can't always keep the car, but we can keep the memories - though sometimes those memories aren't always positive because the business can be tough.

It's sad to have to sell cars just to make ends meet, and it's hard to justify continuing to develop unique restoration skills when society pushes us to think only about monetizing at the point of sale. This is a horrible experience for people who are passionate about restoration, sustainability, heritage, and history.

You need to be fairly intelligent to dismantle and restore a vehicle, and having a simple system to track that work would create enough justification to continue in this profession. Making the profession more digitally minded makes sense because much of the effort is mental and can be digitized.

Digital professionals already have amazing systems like GitHub profiles that showcase their work and tell their story. Why can't there be something similar for automotive professionals? When you look at someone's GitHub, you can track what they've worked on and determine if they're a good fit. This would work perfectly in the automotive industry, especially for skilled technical work.

Sometimes it's hard for someone to understand what they're skilled in, but a system tracking what they've developed could help them understand what to focus on. So many people in this industry don't get recognition for their existence and contributions - this could be a way to pay homage to those efforts.

## Everyday Car Owners

**Q: How do you see the everyday car owner fitting into this ecosystem?**

A: The everyday car owner will recognize the value when they try to sell their vehicle. It will hit them like a ton of bricks that this is the best system to use. They'll likely upload all their information and try to sell their car as quickly as possible, hopefully getting more money than what a dealer might offer.

This platform might also be where people buy their first car, since it's the most verified source of vehicle information. People typically use their phones for purchases, and they'd find this platform when searching for where to buy a car. They'd download the app and discover they can easily find what they want and make offers.

Many people become car experts out of necessity, and some discover they actually enjoy it. This platform provides a solution where their efforts can be documented. Any level of interaction, even as a casual owner, can be easily recorded as long as the system is in place.

## Geographic Strategy and Partnerships

**Q: What geographic region are you planning to start in, and how do you envision the rollout of PTZ shops?**

A: For geographic regions, I would start in big cities. I'm based in Las Vegas, so I think the first PTZ shop should be here. It's a good location because many special vehicles pass through.

The PTZ shops would be smaller locations, while I envision central hubs that are like mass vehicle storage facilities, similar to what's called a "freeport" in the art world. These larger freeports would be installed in major cities or within reasonable distance of them - Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Francisco, New York, Miami.

These central hubs would become cultural centerpieces for the community and provide a way for hardcore collectors to justify their collecting behaviors. They could quickly buy a vehicle at the push of a button, arrange shipping, and have it sent to their storage spot.

If there's not enough storage space, users could start crowdfunding or petitioning for expansion, allowing the system to grow organically through democratized expansion. If someone with money encourages their friends to invest in property development for vehicle storage, they might receive an early adopter bonus with higher allocation of parking spots - almost like democratized Monopoly.

## Partnerships Strategy

**Q: Would you consider partnering with existing businesses like restoration shops or detailers in the early stages?**

A: My goal with partnerships is to first focus on tech, then partner with individuals. It really starts with getting the product into the hands of everyone who wants to work hard and will say, "This is what I've been looking for."

Once we have that, high-end restoration shops, detailing businesses, and specialty mechanics will naturally flock to the platform because that's where their customers are. If the cost of entry is as low as possible - ideally close to zero - they have every reason to join.

People are already accustomed to paying commissions at the point of sale, so there's a built-in standard for monetization. Even if the platform took just 0.5% of every sale, that would be significant revenue at scale.

The partnership process could be largely automated. For example, when a second freeport needs to be built, a notification could be sent to profiles specializing in real estate development. People would submit applications to partner on projects where they have expertise, creating quick partnership opportunities.

Ultimately, my core partners would be the tech solutions providers needed to build the system.

## Funding Strategy

**Q: How are you thinking about the capital required to reach your first meaningful milestone?**

A: When I think about funding, I quickly start thinking about what I would spend the money on. This typically leads me to visualize finding the right tech professionals in Silicon Valley who can help build the system with me.

The funding is deeply tied to specific needs. The money for real estate developments would likely come from real estate investment firms and individuals who want to be involved. I already have people offering to work on certain aspects of the technology, real estate, and database - they're just waiting for me to provide a semi-working product.

I don't know if crowdfunding is ideal because I don't yet have a product that makes sense to a broad audience, and crowdfunding systems are already heavily exploited. I believe that once the system is working and available, it will be naturally adopted.

## Critical Next Steps

**Q: What do you see as the most critical next step to move Nuke from concept to reality?**

A: My most critical next step is properly communicating with technical experts to build a rough functioning deployment. Looking at my repository, you can see how close I am. My critical next move is to get the platform up and running so I can send people links and ask investors to start inputting their vehicles.

If I can generate users from my personal network, I would have a beautiful portfolio of initial users. My next step is just getting my immediate social circle to put their cars onto my platform.

## Success Metrics

**Q: Once you have that initial version and your first users, what metrics will you look for to determine if you're on the right track?**

A: We'll look at the standard metrics that Y Combinator values, like "getting to one" (dollar of revenue). We should see a massive rate of adoption, user growth, and vehicle profile creation. Once we hit a certain critical mass, we'll start seeing the next iteration - people developing their careers through the platform and sponsorships reaching out.

We'll also likely see pushback from corporations who recognize this as a disruptive tool in the industry. The amount of disruption taking place would be another feedback metric, along with how effectively we're cleaning up dishonesty in the industry.

## Motivation

**Q: What keeps you motivated to build Nuke despite the challenges ahead?**

A: My motivation is linked to my personal need for this tool. I'm not too familiar with all the potential challenges ahead, other than knowing that everything I'm dealing with is already difficult. I see this as an exchange of one type of difficulty for another.

I'm much more interested in pursuing something with significant potential. I currently exist in a unique time where this type of technology doesn't exist, but after actions I take, it might possibly exist - which is extremely interesting to me.

I also have multiple decades of experience that I don't want to waste, and many years ahead to continue developing this vision.
