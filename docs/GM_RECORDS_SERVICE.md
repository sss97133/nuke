# GM Vehicle Records Service

This document outlines the implementation of the Classic GM Vehicle Service Records page, which is part of Nuke's vehicle documentation service offering.

## Overview

The GM Vehicle Records Service is a specialized component of the Nuke platform that allows users to obtain official service records from GM's Heritage Center Archive for classic GM vehicles. This service integrates with our vehicle timeline and documentation features, providing additional authenticity for vehicle histories.

## Implementation Details

The service is implemented as a standalone HTML page that is accessible via the Nuke platform:

- **URL Path**: `/gm-vehicle-records.html`
- **File Location**: `/public/gm-vehicle-records.html`
- **Deployment**: The page is automatically deployed with the main Nuke application through our standard Vercel deployment process.

## Features

- Complete form for requesting GM service records
- Detailed explanation of the service process
- Pricing information
- Testimonials from previous users
- FAQ section

## Integration with Nuke Platform

The GM Vehicle Records Service integrates with the Nuke platform's vehicle-centric architecture in the following ways:

1. **Digital Vehicle Identity**: Records obtained through this service become part of the vehicle's digital identity timeline.
2. **Trust Mechanisms**: Official GM documentation provides high-confidence validation for vehicle authenticity.
3. **Data Integration**: Records are processed through our multi-source connector framework, maintaining consistency with other vehicle data.

## Technical Considerations

### Environment Configuration

The page respects the standard environment configuration pattern used throughout the Nuke application, with environment variables injected at build time via the `scripts/inject-env.js` script.

### Deployment Process

The page is deployed as part of the standard production build process:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This process includes environment variable injection, static asset optimization, and verification.

## Updating the Service

When updates to the GM Vehicle Records Service are needed:

1. Modify the `/public/gm-vehicle-records.html` file
2. Test the changes locally using `npm run dev`
3. Deploy to production using the standard deployment process

## User Data Handling

Form submissions from this page are processed through our standard data pipeline, which includes:

1. Data validation and sanitization
2. Secure storage in our Supabase backend
3. Processing through our service fulfillment workflow

All user data is handled according to our privacy policy and data protection standards.
