# Payment-First Onboarding System - Summary

**Concept**: Invoices become the entry point for client onboarding  
**Purpose**: Financial motivation drives profile creation  
**Date**: November 22, 2025

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

### **The Problem**:
- Traditional onboarding requires account creation first
- Clients are hesitant to create accounts without seeing value
- Small contractors struggle to get clients on the platform

### **The Solution**:
- **Invoices are the entry point** - clients receive payment links
- **No login required** - view and pay invoices via public link
- **Payment confirmation** - clients mark as paid, creating engagement
- **Onboarding hook** - after payment, offer account creation to track all invoices

## 📊 System Architecture (ERD)

```
TIMELINE_EVENTS (work done)
    ↓
GENERATED_INVOICES (invoice created)
    ├─ payment_token (public access key)
    ├─ payment_link (https://n-zero.dev/pay/TOKEN)
    ├─ preferred_payment_method
    └─ payment_method_details (JSONB)
        ↓
PUBLIC INVOICE VIEW (no auth)
    ↓
CLIENT PAYS (Venmo/Zelle/PayPal/Stripe/Cash)
    ↓
PAYMENT CONFIRMED
    ↓
OPTIONAL: Client creates account ← ONBOARDING HOOK
```

```

### **2. Client Receives Link**
```

```

### **3. Client Pays**
```

## 🎯 Onboarding Strategy

### **Phase 1: Payment** (No Account Required)
```

2. Views invoice (no login)
3. Selects payment method
4. Pays and confirms
5. Gets receipt confirmation
```

### **Phase 2: Onboarding Hook** (Optional Account)
```
After payment confirmation:

"Want to track all your invoices?

Create a free account to:
• See all past invoices
• Download receipts anytime
• Track payment history
• Get invoice notifications

[CREATE FREE ACCOUNT]  or  [No thanks, continue]"
```

### **Phase 3: Account Benefits** (Post-Signup)

• Receipt storage
• Email notifications
• Multi-shop support (future)
```
