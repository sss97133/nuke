# Vehicle-Specific AI Training Architecture for Nuke Platform

## Overview
Each vehicle becomes a self-contained AI training environment with multiple validation layers and continuous learning from expert contributions.

## 1. Vehicle-Specific Training Buckets

### Data Structure per Vehicle:
```
Vehicle Bucket: 1977-Chevrolet-K5-Blazer-CKR187F127263/
├── validation_hierarchy/
│   ├── title_verified/          # 100% trusted baseline
│   ├── user_contributed/        # Human-provided data
│   ├── expert_validated/        # Professional approval
│   └── community_consensus/     # Group verification
├── training_data/
│   ├── images/                 # All 700+ images with timestamps
│   ├── repair_events/          # 239 timeline events
│   ├── receipts/              # Financial validation

│   ├── gm_archives/           # Official GM documentation
│   ├── repair_manuals/        # Factory service manuals
│   ├── forum_discussions/     # Community knowledge
│   └── parts_catalogs/        # OEM and aftermarket

    ├── recognition_model/     # Vehicle-specific recognition
    ├── repair_timeline/       # Event correlation engine
    └── value_assessment/      # Impact on vehicle value
```

## 2. Training Pipeline Design

### Stage 1: Baseline Establishment
- **Title as Ground Truth**: VIN + Title = 100% confidence anchor
- **Factory Specs**: GM archives for this exact year/model
- **Known History**: Previous ownership, documented repairs

### Stage 2: Human Validation Layers
```python
class ValidationHierarchy:
    CONFIDENCE_LEVELS = {
        'title_verified': 100,      # Legal document proof
        'expert_certified': 95,     # Professional mechanic/appraiser
        'multi_user_consensus': 85, # 3+ users agree
        'single_user_claim': 60,    # Unverified user input
        'ai_detection': 40          # Rekognition baseline
    }
```

### Stage 3: Continuous Learning Loop
1. **Image Analysis**: Rekognition detects parts/repairs
2. **Timeline Correlation**: Match with repair receipts/dates
3. **Expert Review**: Mechanics validate AI findings
4. **Model Refinement**: Update vehicle-specific weights

## 3. Repair Timeline Correlation Engine

### Smart Event Detection:
```sql
-- Match repair events with visual evidence
SELECT
    te.event_date,
    te.description,
    te.category,
    te.cost,
    COUNT(DISTINCT img_tags.tag_name) as detected_parts,
    AVG(img_tags.confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM timeline_events te
JOIN image_tags img_tags ON img_tags.timeline_event_id = te.id
WHERE te.vehicle_id = 'K5_BLAZER_ID'
GROUP BY te.id
ORDER BY te.event_date;
```

### Value Impact Assessment:
- **Repair Magnitude**: Cost + complexity + parts affected
- **Vehicle Value Change**: Before/after market comparisons
- **User Experience Score**: Learning value for community

## 4. Vehicle-Specific Recognition Training

### Custom Model per Vehicle Family:
```javascript
// Vehicle-specific label mapping
const K5_BLAZER_LABELS = {
    "removable_top": { confidence_boost: 0.2, value_impact: "high" },
    "tailgate": { confidence_boost: 0.15, value_impact: "medium" },
    "np205_transfer_case": { confidence_boost: 0.3, value_impact: "high" },
    "14_bolt_rear_axle": { confidence_boost: 0.25, value_impact: "medium" }
};
```

### Training Data Sources:
1. **175 verified images** from your K5 Blazer
2. **GM Archives**: Factory photos, schematics
3. **Community Contributions**: Other K5 owners' validated images
4. **Expert Annotations**: Mechanic-tagged repair photos

## 5. Expert Validation System

### Professional Scoring:
```python
class ExpertValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.expert_types = {
            'certified_appraiser': 1.0,
            'ase_mechanic': 0.9,
            'marque_specialist': 0.95,
            'restoration_expert': 0.85
        }

    def validate_repair_claim(self, event, images, expert_credentials):
        base_score = self.ai_analysis_score(images)
        expert_multiplier = self.expert_types.get(expert_credentials, 0.5)
        return min(base_score * expert_multiplier, 1.0)
```
