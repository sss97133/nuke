# 🎯 Owner Metrics Redesign - October 27, 2025

## ❌ BEFORE: Useless Placeholder Data

```
Value: Not estimated
Profile: Incomplete
Activity: No views yet
```

**Problem:** These tell the owner NOTHING actionable.

---

## ✅ AFTER: Owner-Relevant Metrics

### 1. **ROI (Return on Investment)** 💰

**What it shows:**
```
ROI: +$138,615 (6,930%)  ← Green if profit
ROI: -$5,000 (25%)       ← Red if loss
ROI: $140,615            ← Just value if no purchase price
ROI: Add purchase price  ← Call to action if missing
```

**Why it matters:**
- **Shows if making/losing money**
- Color-coded (green = profit, red = loss)
- Percentage gain tells full story
- Motivates adding purchase price if missing

**Calculation:**
```typescript
const roi = current_value - purchase_price;
const roiPercent = (roi / purchase_price) * 100;
```

---

### 2. **Build (Documentation Progress)** 📊

**What it shows:**
```
Build: 617 photos · 290 events · 140h
Build: 131 photos · 0 events
Build: 0 photos · 0 events  ← Needs documentation!
```

**Why it matters:**
- **Shows documentation completeness**
- Photo count = visual proof of condition
- Event count = timeline richness
- Hours tracked = labor value

**Owner's Questions Answered:**
- "How well documented is this vehicle?"
- "Do I have enough photos to sell?"
- "Have I tracked my work hours?"

---

### 3. **Interest (Market Demand)** 👁️

**What it shows:**
```
Interest: 569 views · 2 inquiries · $150k bid
Interest: 45 views · 1 inquiry
Interest: 0 views  ← No market interest yet
```

**Why it matters:**
- **Shows buyer demand**
- Views = how many people interested
- Inquiries = serious buyers
- Current bid = market price signal

**Owner's Questions Answered:**
- "Should I sell now?"
- "Is there demand for this vehicle?"
- "What's the real market price?"

---

## 📊 Owner's Mental Model

### What Owners Actually Care About:

**Financial Performance:**
- Am I making money on this build?
- What's my return on investment?
- Should I sell or keep building?

**Build Progress:**
- How much have I documented?
- What's my time investment?
- Am I on track to complete?

**Market Opportunity:**
- Is anyone interested in buying?
- What's the real market demand?
- Should I list it for sale?

**Next Actions:**
- What's missing from my profile?
- How do I increase value?
- What should I document next?

---

## 🎯 Design Rationale

### Why ROI Instead of "Value"?

**"Value: Not estimated"** → Useless, tells nothing  
**"ROI: +$138,615 (6,930%)"** → Shows you're crushing it!

Context matters. Owners know what they paid. They want to know if they're winning.

### Why "Build" Instead of "Profile"?

**"Profile: Incomplete"** → Vague, demotivating  
**"Build: 617 photos · 290 events"** → Shows tangible progress

Owners don't care about "completion percentage" - they care about documentation volume and quality.

### Why "Interest" Instead of "Activity"?

**"Activity: No views yet"** → Sad, discouraging  
**"Interest: 569 views · 2 inquiries"** → Shows market validation

Owners want to know if people care about their build. Views = interest = potential buyers.
