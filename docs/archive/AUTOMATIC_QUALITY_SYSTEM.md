# 🔍 AUTOMATIC QUALITY INSPECTOR - COMPLETE SYSTEM

**Philosophy:** Like Git/CI/CD - automatic facts, zero user interaction  
**User Provides:** Images + Receipts + Ownership  
**System Provides:** Quality grade + Investment confidence  

---

## ⚡ **HOW IT WORKS (Completely Automatic):**

### **User Journey:**
```
Day 1: Upload 20 images of truck
       → System: "Analyzing... Quality: 5.2/10 (preliminary)"

Day 30: Upload 50 more images + 10 receipts
        → System: "Quality: 6.8/10 (improving)"

Day 90: Upload final 130 images + 37 receipts, complete timeline
        → System: "Quality: 8.7/10 ⭐ | Grade: A+ | 94% confidence"

Day 91: Click "Open to Market"
        → System: Creates investment offering instantly
        → Investors see: "A+ Grade, 94% confidence"
        → Money flows in
```

**User never clicked "Calculate Quality". It just updates automatically.**

## 🧠 **WHAT THE SYSTEM TRACKS (Invisible):**

### **From Images (AI Analysis):**
```javascript
{
  parts_identified: 47,
  oem_parts_count: 28,
  name_brand_count: 12,
  aftermarket_count: 7,
  parts_quality_score: 8.2  // Auto-calculated
}
```

### **From Documentation:**
```javascript
{
  image_count: 200,
  receipt_count: 47,
  timeline_events: 115,
  tagged_parts: 47,
  documentation_score: 9.1  // Auto-calculated
}
```

### **From Builder:**
```javascript
{
  builder_id: "summit-restoration-shop",
  builder_verified: true,
  past_builds: 23,
  avg_quality: 8.4,
  builder_score: 9.0  // Auto-calculated
}
```

### **From Timeline:**
```javascript
{
  first_event: "2024-01-15",
  last_event: "2024-09-10",
  duration_months: 8,
  events_per_month: 14.4,
  timeline_score: 8.8  // Auto-calculated (realistic pace)
}
```

### **From Ownership:**
```javascript
{
  title_verified: true,
  owner_vehicle_count: 4,
  owner_active: true,
  owner_score: 9.5  // Auto-calculated
}
```

## 📊 **THE FORMULA:**

```
Overall Quality = 
  Parts Quality (30%) +
  Documentation (25%) +
  Builder Cred (20%) +
  Timeline Realism (15%) +
  Owner Cred (10%)

Investment Grade = Letter grade (A+ to F)
Confidence = How verifiable is this? (0-100%)
```

### **Example Calculations:**

**High Quality Build:**
```
Parts: 8.2 × 0.30 = 2.46
Docs:  9.1 × 0.25 = 2.28
Builder: 9.0 × 0.20 = 1.80
Timeline: 8.8 × 0.15 = 1.32
Owner: 9.5 × 0.10 = 0.95
───────────────────────
Total: 8.81/10 → Grade: A
Confidence: (9.1×0.5 + 9.5×0.3 + 9.0×0.2) × 10 = 92%
```

**Low Quality Build:**
```
Parts: 4.1 × 0.30 = 1.23
Docs:  2.5 × 0.25 = 0.63
Builder: 3.0 × 0.20 = 0.60
Timeline: 2.1 × 0.15 = 0.32  (2 weeks - suspicious!)
Owner: 3.5 × 0.10 = 0.35
───────────────────────
Total: 3.13/10 → Grade: C-
Confidence: (2.5×0.5 + 3.5×0.3 + 3.0×0.2) × 10 = 31%
```

## 🎨 **WHERE FACTS APPEAR (No New Screens):**

### **1. Vehicle Profile Header:**
```tsx
<div className="vehicle-header">
  <h1>1974 Chevrolet K10</h1>
  
  {/* These facts appear automatically */}
  <div className="quality-badge">
    Quality: {vehicle.quality_grade}/10 ⭐
    Grade: {vehicle.investment_grade}
    {vehicle.investment_confidence}% confidence
  </div>
  
  {/* Only show if not already listed */}
  {vehicle.investment_grade >= 'B' && !vehicle.market_listed && (
    <button onClick={openToMarket}>Open to Market →</button>
  )}
</div>
```

### **2. Vehicle Card (Homepage):**
```tsx
<div className="vehicle-card">
  1974 Chevrolet K10
  Quality: 8.7/10 ⭐ Grade: A+
  200 img • 47 receipts • 8mo build
  $12,450
</div>
```

### **3. Market Browse (Investment Filter):**
```tsx
<div className="market-filters">
  Show: 
  <button>All</button>
  <button>A-Grade Only</button> ← Investors trust high-grade builds
  <button>Verified Only</button>
</div>
```

## 🔄 **AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS:**

### **Every Time User Acts:**
```
User uploads image
  → AI analyzes (already built)
  → Tags parts (already built)
  → Quality inspector runs (new - automatic)
  → Facts update in UI (no reload needed)

User adds receipt
  → Receipt saved (already built)
  → Quality inspector runs (automatic)
  → Documentation score increases
  → Facts update

User verifies ownership
  → Title verification (already built)
  → Quality inspector runs (automatic)
  → Owner score jumps to 9.5/10
  → Investment grade improves
```

**Like compilation: Make changes → Auto-rebuild → See results**

## 💰 **ONE-CLICK MARKET OPENING:**

### **When User Clicks "Open to Market":**
```typescript
async function openToMarket(vehicleId) {
  // System already knows EVERYTHING:
  const vehicle = await getVehicle(vehicleId);
  
  // Use existing quality inspection data
  const offering = {
    vehicle_id: vehicleId,
    quality_grade: vehicle.quality_grade,  // Auto-calculated
    investment_grade: vehicle.investment_grade,  // Auto-calculated
    confidence: vehicle.investment_confidence,  // Auto-calculated
    
    // Use existing parts data for "use of funds"
    parts_breakdown: await getPartsBreakdown(vehicleId),
    
    // Use existing timeline for "completion timeline"
    timeline: await getTimeline(vehicleId),
    
    // Calculate share price from quality
    shares_total: 1000,
    price_per_share_cents: calculateSharePrice(vehicle),
    
    status: 'active'
  };
  
  await db.insert('vehicle_offerings', offering);
  
  // Done. Vehicle is now investable.
  // Investors see quality grade + confidence score.
}
```

**No forms. System auto-populates everything from existing data.**
