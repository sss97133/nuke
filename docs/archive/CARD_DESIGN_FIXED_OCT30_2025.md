# Card Design Fixed - October 30, 2025

## The Problem

The `CursorHomepage.tsx` was NOT using the `VehicleCardDense` component that you had already designed. Instead, it was rendering large, vertical cards inline:

**Old Design (WRONG):**
- ‚ùå 200px tall image on TOP
- ‚ùå Info panel BELOW image
- ‚ùå Large vertical cards in grid layout
- ‚ùå 300px minimum width per card
- ‚ùå Wasted space, low information density

**Your Original Spec (VehicleCardDense):**
- ‚úÖ 60x60px thumbnail on LEFT
- ‚úÖ Info on RIGHT (horizontal layout)
- ‚úÖ Dense, small text (8pt-10pt)
- ‚úÖ Single row per vehicle
- ‚úÖ High information density
- ‚úÖ Cursor/VSCode aesthetic

---

## The Fix

### Changed: `nuke_frontend/src/pages/CursorHomepage.tsx` (lines 581-759)

**Before:**
```tsx
{/* Feed Grid */}
<div style={{
  display: 'grid',
  gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))',
  gap: 'var(--space-3)'
}}>
  {feedVehicles.map((vehicle) => (
    <div> {/* Large 200px image + content below */}
      <div style={{ height: '200px' }}>Image</div>
      <div style={{ padding: '12px' }}>Content</div>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
{/* Dense Feed List - Using VehicleCardDense component */}
<div style={{
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: 'column',
  gap: '0'
}}>
  {feedVehicles.map((vehicle) => (
    <VehicleCardDense
      key={vehicle.id}
      vehicle={{
        ...vehicle,
        primary_image_url: vehicle.primary_image_url
      }}
      viewMode="list"
    />
  ))}
</div>
```

**Result:**
- Now uses your existing `VehicleCardDense` component
- Renders in "list" mode: 60px thumbnail LEFT, info RIGHT
- Dense, horizontal layout
- Removed 159 lines of duplicate card rendering code

## What VehicleCardDense Provides (Already Built)

The component at `nuke_frontend/src/components/vehicles/VehicleCardDense.tsx` has 3 view modes:

### 1. **LIST** (Now Active on Homepage)
- 60x60px thumbnail on left
- Grid layout: `60px | 2fr | 1fr | 1fr | 80px | 60px`
- Shows: Image | Vehicle Name | Stats | Counts | Value | Profit
- 8pt-9pt fonts
- 1px borders
- Hover: border highlight

### 2. **GRID** (For gallery views)
- Square cards
- 200x200px image
- Value badge overlay
- Profit badge if applicable
- Dense info panel below

### 3. **GALLERY** (For full-width hero)
- 300px tall hero image
- Data overlay on image bottom
- Full financial stats
- Event/image counts

## Why This Happened

Looking at the PRs and git history, it appears that:

1. You originally designed `VehicleCardDense.tsx` with the correct layout
2. The `CursorHomepage.tsx` was built separately and used inline card rendering
3. The two were never connected
4. Previous changes focused on time period filters, ETF navigation, and mobile gestures
5. But nobody replaced the card rendering code to use the dense component

## Deployed

**Commit:** `d2c2d8ab` - "üé® CARD DESIGN FIX: Replace large vertical cards with dense horizontal VehicleCardDense layout"

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Removed 159 lines of duplicate card code
- ‚úÖ Added 11 lines to use VehicleCardDense
- ‚úÖ Build successful
- ‚úÖ Pushed to production
- ‚úÖ Vercel deploying now

**URL:** https://n-zero.dev

The homepage will now show your dense, horizontal card layout as originally specified.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify on production** - Check https://n-zero.dev once Vercel deploys (2-3 minutes)
2. **Mobile view** - The dense cards should work well on mobile too
3. **Other pages** - Consider updating `/market`, `/portfolio`, and other vehicle lists to use VehicleCardDense consistently
