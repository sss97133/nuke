### **4. Intelligence Infrastructure** 🧠
```
Database "mind" that understands parts:

What It Knows:
✅ Every part that exists (catalog)
✅ Where parts are located (dimensional mapping)
✅ What condition looks like (guidelines)
✅ How wear happens (patterns)
✅ How to grade quality (1-10 scale)
✅ How condition affects value (multipliers)
✅ Repair vs replace economics (ROI)
✅ Labor variables by shop type
✅ Material costs and availability

Example:
User clicks dashboard bezel →
System knows: Part #38-8102, $90 new, condition 6/10,
worth $45, repair costs $8, replace costs $68,
recommend REPAIR (94% ROI)
