# Photo Library Progress - Current Status

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Database Schema
- ✅ Migration file created: `20251123200000_personal_photo_library.sql`
- ✅ Makes `vehicle_id` nullable in `vehicle_images` table
- ✅ Adds AI processing status columns
- ✅ Adds organization status tracking
- ✅ Creates `vehicle_suggestions` table for AI groupings
- ✅ Updates `image_sets` for personal albums
- ✅ Creates helper views (`user_photo_inbox`, `user_organized_photos`, `ai_processing_queue`)
- ✅ RLS policies updated for new nullable structure

**Status**: Migration SQL ready - needs manual application via Supabase Dashboard

### 2. Frontend Components
- ✅ `PersonalPhotoLibrary.tsx` - Main photo organization interface
  - Full-screen photo grid with adjustable density
  - Sidebar filters (organized/unorganized, AI status, angles)
  - Bulk upload with drag-and-drop
  - Multi-select with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+A, Escape)
  - Photo info panel
  - Vehicle suggestions panel
  
- ✅ `PersonalPhotoLibraryService.ts` - API service layer
  - `getUnorganizedPhotos()` - Fetch photos for organization
  - `getVehicleSuggestions()` - Get AI-generated groupings
  - `getLibraryStats()` - Statistics for profile page
  - Bulk action methods

- ✅ `Profile.tsx` integration
  - Photos tab renders `PersonalPhotoLibrary` component directly
  - Financials tab renders `ShopFinancials` component directly
  - Fixed X-Frame-Options issue (no more iframe blocking)

### 3. Routing & Navigation
- ✅ Route `/photos` configured in `App.tsx`
- ✅ Profile tabs working (Photos & Financials)
- ✅ Direct component rendering (no navigation/iframe issues)

### 4. Deployment
- ✅ Latest code pushed to GitHub (commit `7c35afe5`)
- ✅ Vercel deployment triggered
- ⚠️ **Bundle cache issue**: Production still serving old bundle `BAjz8cCe.js`
  - Local builds generate `90GDgr42.js` (new code)
  - Multiple attempts to invalidate cache (version bump, forced deploys)
  - Root cause: Vercel build cache not invalidating

## ⚠️ BLOCKING ISSUES

### Bundle Cache / Deployment
**Problem**: Production site (`nuke.ag`) still serves old JavaScript bundle despite:
- Code changes pushed to GitHub
- Multiple Vercel deployments completed
- Version number bumped in package.json

**Impact**: Users may see old design/functionality

**Next Steps**:
1. Clear Vercel build cache via dashboard (Settings → Build & Development Settings → Clear build cache)
2. OR manually trigger rebuild with environment variable change
3. OR wait for natural cache expiration

### Database Migration
**Status**: SQL migration file ready but not applied
**Action Required**: Manual application via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor

## 🚧 PENDING / TODO

1. **Apply Database Migration**
   - Run `20251123200000_personal_photo_library.sql` in Supabase Dashboard
   - Verify tables/views created correctly
   - Test RLS policies

2. **Fix Bundle Cache Issue**
   - Clear Vercel build cache
   - Verify new bundle hash appears on production
   - Test photo library functionality live

3. **Testing**
   - Upload test photos
   - Verify AI processing pipeline
   - Test bulk actions (link to vehicle, mark organized)
   - Test filters and organization workflow

4. **AI Processing Integration**
   - Connect to image analysis service
   - Implement auto-vehicle detection
   - Implement angle detection
   - Generate vehicle suggestions
