## What Remains

### ✅ Clean LMC-Style Interface

**Image lightbox with:**
1. Square spatial dots on parts (green = shop, grey = info)
2. Click dot → `SpatialPartPopup` appears at that location
3. Popup shows suppliers + live pricing
4. Double-click supplier → checkout
5. Bottom: Just "Image X of Y • N shoppable parts"

**Top controls:**
- `← Prev` / `Next →` navigation
- `TAG` button (press T) for tagging mode
- `AI` button for auto-detection
- `Tags: All/Off/AI/Manual` filter
- `PRIMARY` to set main image

**That's it. No sidebar. No clutter.**
