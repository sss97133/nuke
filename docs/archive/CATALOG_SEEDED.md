## Next Step: Incubation Process

**Now need to create the "developing" function:**

```typescript
// incubate-image Edge Function

Input: image_id
Process:
  1. LLM analyzes image
  2. Identifies visible parts
  3. Searches catalog by:
     - Visual features
     - Vehicle context
     - Mounting location
  4. Only creates tags for matches > 85% confidence
  5. Tags inherit real supplier data from catalog
  
Output: Real shoppable tags (green dots)
```
