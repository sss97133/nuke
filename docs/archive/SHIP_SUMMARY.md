## 🚀 HOW A USER AUCTIONS THEIR VEHICLE

### **Step-by-Step Flow:**

```
1. USER LISTS VEHICLE
   └─ Navigates to their vehicle page
   └─ Clicks "Start Trading" button
   └─ System creates 1,000 shares @ $100/share
   └─ Seller owns all 1,000 shares initially

2. OPENING AUCTION (9:30am)
   └─ System collects overnight pre-market orders
   └─ Executes price discovery
   └─ Finds equilibrium price (e.g., $98)
   └─ Seller receives $98,000 in order value
   └─ Opening price set: $98/share

3. INTRADAY TRADING (Throughout day)
   └─ Users place buy/sell orders
   └─ Each order matches instantly or queues
   └─ Price fluctuates based on supply/demand
   └─ Seller watches value change real-time
   └─ Real-time notifications sent

4. CLOSING AUCTION (4:00pm)
   └─ System executes closing price discovery
   └─ Final equilibrium set (e.g., $105)
   └─ All pending orders matched
   └─ Market closes until next day

5. SELLER BENEFITS
   ✓ Monetized their vehicle
   ✓ Sold shares for cash/tokens
   ✓ Kept remaining shares
   ✓ Earned reputation
   ✓ Tracked value appreciation
   ✓ Earned 2% commissions from trades

EXAMPLE OUTCOME:
  Starting: 1,000 shares × $100 = $100,000
  Sold at open: 300 shares × $98 = $29,400
  Remaining: 700 shares × $105 (close) = $73,500
  TOTAL: $102,900 value (+$2,900 in 1 day!)
```
