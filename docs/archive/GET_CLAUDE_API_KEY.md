## Current Status

‚úÖ **The app works WITHOUT Claude** - I've added a fallback parser that:
- Extracts prices and items using pattern matching
- Works with pasted text receipts
- Shows lower confidence scores (30% vs 95% with Claude)

‚ö†Ô∏è **For full features you need Claude**:
- Image receipt parsing (photos)
- PDF receipt parsing
- Smart item categorization
- Accurate vendor detection
- High confidence parsing

## Pricing

Claude API is very affordable:
- ~$0.003 per receipt (Haiku model)
- First $5 free with new accounts
- That's ~1,600 receipts free!

## Test Without API Key

The system now works with the fallback parser. Try:
1. Paste receipt text
2. See it parse (with 30% confidence)
3. Items still get saved to database

Once you add your Claude key:
- Confidence jumps to 95%+
- Image uploads work
- Much better accuracy
