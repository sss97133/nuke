## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE

### **Tech Stack:**

### **Data Flow:**
```
User Action → Frontend → Supabase Edge Function → External API → Webhook → Database → SMS
```

**Example (Facilitation Fee Payment):**
```
[Buy Button Click] 
  → vehicleTransactionService.createTransaction()
  → create-vehicle-transaction-checkout/ Edge Function
  → Stripe API (create checkout)
  → User pays on Stripe
  → stripe-webhook/ receives confirmation
  → generate-transaction-documents/ creates PDFs
  → send-transaction-sms/ sends signing links
  → Database updated
  → SMS delivered via Twilio
```
