## üìã DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Working on Any Component
- [ ] Check CLAUDE_CODE_SAFEGUARDS.md
- [ ] Verify component completion status in this document
- [ ] Confirm real vs mock data status
- [ ] Review authorization requirements

### For Price System Fixes
- [ ] Fix wizard button routing
- [ ] Add edit mode to price display
- [ ] Implement proper owner/consigner authorization
- [ ] Connect to real market data sources
- [ ] Remove any placeholder price values

### For Data Quality Enhancements
- [ ] Add click handler for detailed breakdown
- [ ] Create modal for source management
- [ ] Add improvement suggestion UI
- [ ] Test with real vehicle data

### For General Edit Capabilities
- [ ] Identify which fields should be editable by whom
- [ ] Implement inline editing interface
- [ ] Add save/cancel functionality
- [ ] Handle authorization properly
- [ ] Provide clear feedback on changes

## üöÄ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### A Tool is "Complete" When:
- [ ] Uses only real data from database
- [ ] Provides edit capabilities where appropriate
- [ ] Enforces proper authorization levels
- [ ] Follows Windows 95 design system
- [ ] Has proper error handling
- [ ] Includes loading states
- [ ] Works without placeholder/mock data

### A Tool is "Living" When:
- [ ] Users can modify their own data
- [ ] Changes save to database properly
- [ ] UI clearly indicates edit capabilities
- [ ] Authorization prevents unauthorized changes
- [ ] Real-time updates work properly

**BOTTOM LINE**: The core tools are more sophisticated than expected, but they lack proper editing interfaces and some have routing issues. The data quality system is actually excellent - it just needs better user interaction. The main work needed is enabling edit modes and fixing wizard integrations.**
