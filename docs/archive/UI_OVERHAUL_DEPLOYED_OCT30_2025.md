## 📦 WHAT'S BEEN DEPLOYED

### 1. Hero Carousel Redesign ✓
**Files Modified:** `CursorHomepage.tsx`, `MobileHeroCarousel.tsx` (NEW)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed all emojis from badges (JUST POSTED, ACTIVE BUILD, TRENDING, etc.)
- ✅ Refined typography: smaller (9pt), cleaner text with modern font weights (600/700)
- ✅ Removed trashy "INVEST" buttons from hero banner
- ✅ Glass-morphism badges: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)` with backdrop blur and subtle borders
- ✅ Modern color palette: #4ade80 (green gains), #f87171 (red losses)
- ✅ Mobile-specific smooth swipe carousel with haptic feedback

**Before:**
```
💰 6931% GAIN (with emoji)
[INVEST $10] [INVEST $50] [INVEST $100] (green buttons)
```

**After:**
```
6931% GAIN (clean badge, no emoji)
(no invest buttons - card is fully clickable instead)
```

### 2. Clickable ETF Navigation ✓
**Files Modified:** `CursorHomepage.tsx`, `Market.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Year/Make/Model are now clickable in hero and feed cards
- ✅ Clicking navigates to Market page with proper filters:
  - Year → `/market?year=1977`
  - Make → `/market?make=Chevrolet`
  - Model → `/market?make=Chevrolet&model=K5`
- ✅ Market page updated to accept URL parameters and filter results
- ✅ Foundation laid for future ETF-style fund pages

**User Experience:**
- Click on "1977" → See all 1977 vehicles
- Click on "Chevrolet" → See all Chevrolet vehicles  
- Click on "K5" → See all Chevrolet K5 vehicles
- Future: Market cap calculations per year/make/model

---

### 3. Time Period Selector ✓
**Files Modified:** `CursorHomepage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added 6 filter buttons to "What's Popping" header:
  - **All Time** (default) - Shows all vehicles
  - **1 Year** - Last 365 days
  - **Quarter** - Last 90 days
  - **Week** - Last 7 days
  - **Day** - Last 24 hours
  - **Live** - Last hour
- ✅ Active state styling with bold font
- ✅ Smooth transitions on hover
- ✅ Persists across page (global state)

**Location:** Header of "What's Popping" section

---

### 4. Time-Based Gains Calculation ✓
**Files Modified:** `CursorHomepage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Vehicles filtered by `updated_at` based on selected time period
- ✅ Dynamic hype scoring:
  - "LIVE NOW" badge for real-time updates (last hour)
  - ROI multipliers: 2x for Daily, 1.5x for Weekly
  - Activity-based scoring
- ✅ Feed dynamically updates when period changes
- ✅ Proper date range filtering in database queries

**Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Real-time activity gets highest score
if (updated_last_hour && timePeriod === 'RT') {
  hypeScore += 60;
  badge = 'LIVE NOW';
}

// ROI weighted by time period
if (roi > 100%) {
  multiplier = timePeriod === 'D' ? 2 : timePeriod === 'W' ? 1.5 : 1;
  hypeScore += 40 * multiplier;
}
```

---

### 5. Feed Card Refinement ✓
**Files Modified:** `CursorHomepage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed all "Quick Invest" buttons from feed cards
- ✅ Cleaner spacing: 12px padding (up from 8px)
- ✅ Monospace font for prices (better readability)
- ✅ Modern gain/loss badges with colored backgrounds:
  - Green gain: `rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.1)` background
  - Red loss: `rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.1)` background
- ✅ All data elements (year/make/model) clickable
- ✅ Hover effects on clickable elements

**Stats Line:**
- Photos: image count
- Events: timeline event count
- Views: vehicle view count

### 6. Mobile Timeline Redesign ✓
**Files Modified:** `MobileTimelineVisual.tsx` (NEW), `MobileVehicleProfile.tsx`

**Complete Redesign - "Wow Factor":**
- ✅ **Large touchable month cards** (200px height)
- ✅ **Photo previews** as card backgrounds with gradient overlays
- ✅ **Event count badges** (circular, top-right corner)
- ✅ **Instagram-story style** bottom sheet modal
- ✅ **Horizontal photo scroll** in event cards (120px squares)
- ✅ **Smooth animations** with cubic-bezier easing
- ✅ **Modern design**: Rounded corners, glass effects
- ✅ Much better for vertical mobile viewing

**Old Design Issues:**
- Tiny squares hard to tap

- No visual impact

**New Design:**
```
[Month Card with Photo]
├── Background: Photo preview with gradient
├── Badge: Event count (top-right)
├── Info: "January 2024"
└── Stats: "15 events · 45 photos · 12.5h"

Tap → Opens modal with:
  ├── Event cards (scrollable)
  ├── Horizontal photo scroll per event
  └── Metadata badges
```

- ✅ **Responsive detection**: Shows mobile carousel on <768px

**Gestures:**
