## Example Screen Recording Script (Verbose)

```
[0:00-0:05] "This is our automotive platform where users can connect their social media accounts."

[0:05-0:10] "Here's our login page with the Facebook Login button."

[0:10-0:25] "When a user clicks 'Login with Facebook', they're taken to Facebook's login screen. 
You can see here that user_videos is one of the permissions being requested. 
The user clicks 'Continue' to grant permission."

[0:25-0:35] "After logging in, the user is redirected back to our app and can see their dashboard."

[0:35-0:45] "Now I'm navigating to the user's vehicle profiles. 
Here's a vehicle profile for a Lamborghini."

[0:45-1:15] "In the vehicle profile, you can see a 'Videos' section. 
These are videos the user uploaded to Facebook that we're displaying in their vehicle profile.
Notice the clear ownership attribution - it says 'Your Videos from Facebook' and shows the user's name.
These are the user's own videos displayed in their own profile, which aligns with Facebook's allowed usage 
for displaying videos with owners in social apps."

[1:15-1:25] "I can click on a video to play it, showing it's functional."

[1:25-1:35] "In the account settings, users can see their connected Facebook account 
and can disconnect at any time, giving them full control."

[1:35-1:40] "The videos are only displayed in the user's own profile and are not shared with third parties."
```
