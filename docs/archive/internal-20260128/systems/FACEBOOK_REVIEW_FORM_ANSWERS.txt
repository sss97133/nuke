ANSWER:
USE CASE: Our platform connects automotive enthusiasts with their vehicle collections through social media integration.

STEP-BY-STEP USER FLOW:

1. User visits our platform and clicks "Login with Facebook"

- User connects Instagram account
- User posts a photo of their Ferrari at a car show in Las Vegas
- Our AI detects it's a Ferrari from the image

QUESTION: Tell us how your use of public_profile follows established usage guidelines

ANSWER:
We use public_profile to display basic user information when users log in with Facebook:

- Profile picture: Used as default avatar (if user_photos not granted, we use the profile picture URL from public_profile)
- Profile link: Stored for reference and displayed in user profiles

This data is essential for user identification and personalization. Users explicitly choose to log in with Facebook, so they understand we're accessing their public profile information.

Usage follows guidelines:
- Only accessed when user explicitly logs in with Facebook
- Data is stored securely in our database
- Users can disconnect their Facebook account at any time
- We do not share this data with third parties

QUESTION: Tell us how your use of user_videos follows established usage guidelines
---
ANSWER:
We use user_videos in accordance with Facebook's allowed usage for displaying videos with owners in social apps:

PRIMARY USE CASE - DISPLAYING VIDEOS WITH OWNERS:
Our platform functions as a social app where users create profiles for their vehicle collections. Each vehicle profile acts as a social profile where users can display their own videos. This aligns with Facebook's allowed usage for "displaying videos with owners within their app, for example in dating or social apps."

HOW IT WORKS:
1. User uploads a video of their vehicle (e.g., Lamborghini track day video) to Facebook
2. User grants user_videos permission when logging in with Facebook
3. Our app accesses videos the user has uploaded
4. Videos are displayed in the user's vehicle profile (their "social profile" for that vehicle)
5. Videos are shown with clear ownership attribution - the user can see their videos displayed in their own vehicle collection

VALUE TO USER:
- Users can showcase their vehicle videos in their vehicle profiles
- Creates a comprehensive media gallery for each vehicle (photos + videos)
- Users maintain full control - videos are only displayed in their own profiles
- Users can disconnect Facebook and remove videos at any time

ANALYTICS INSIGHTS (AGGREGATED & ANONYMIZED):
We also use aggregated, anonymized video data to improve our vehicle detection algorithms:
- Analyzing video metadata (not individual videos) to improve AI detection
- Understanding common video formats/types for better processing
- All analytics are aggregated and cannot be re-identified to individual users
- Used solely to improve app functionality, not for marketing or advertising

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Only access videos uploaded by the user (not videos they're tagged in)
- Videos are displayed only in the user's own vehicle profiles
- Clear ownership attribution - user sees their videos in their collection
- Users can revoke access and remove videos at any time
- We respect user privacy settings on Facebook
- Videos are NOT shared with third parties
- Videos are NOT used for advertising or marketing purposes

This usage aligns with Facebook's allowed usage for social apps where users display their own content with clear ownership.
