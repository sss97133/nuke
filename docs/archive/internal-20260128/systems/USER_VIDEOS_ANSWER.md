## Detailed Description of How Your App Uses user_videos

Our platform is a social app where automotive enthusiasts create profiles for their vehicle collections. Each vehicle profile functions as a social profile where users can display their own videos, which aligns with Facebook's allowed usage for "displaying videos with owners within their app, for example in dating or social apps."

**How It Works:**
1. User uploads a video of their vehicle (e.g., Lamborghini track day video) to Facebook
2. User grants user_videos permission when logging in with Facebook
3. Our app accesses videos the user has uploaded to Facebook
4. Videos are displayed in the user's vehicle profile (their "social profile" for that vehicle)
5. Videos are shown with clear ownership attribution - the user can see their videos displayed in their own vehicle collection

**Analytics Insights (Aggregated & Anonymized):**
We also use aggregated, anonymized video metadata to improve our vehicle detection algorithms:
- Analyzing video metadata patterns (not individual videos) to improve AI detection accuracy
- Understanding common video formats/types for better processing
- All analytics are aggregated and cannot be re-identified to individual users
- Used solely to improve app functionality, not for marketing or advertising

**Technical Implementation:**
- Only access videos uploaded by the user (not videos they're tagged in)
- Videos are displayed only in the user's own vehicle profiles
- Clear ownership attribution - user sees their videos in their collection
- Users can revoke access and remove videos at any time
- We respect user privacy settings on Facebook
- Videos are NOT shared with third parties
- Videos are NOT used for advertising or marketing purposes

## How It Adds Value for a Person Using Your App

1. **Comprehensive Media Gallery**: Users can build complete media collections for each vehicle (photos + videos) in one place
2. **Showcase Content**: Users can display their vehicle videos in their vehicle profiles, similar to how social apps display user content
3. **Organization**: All vehicle-related media (from Facebook, Instagram, etc.) is organized in one platform
4. **Control**: Users maintain full control - videos are only displayed in their own profiles, and they can disconnect at any time

## Why It's Necessary for App Functionality

1. **Core Feature**: Displaying user videos in vehicle profiles is a core feature of our social app platform
2. **User Expectation**: Users expect to be able to showcase their vehicle videos alongside photos
3. **Social App Functionality**: As a social app for vehicle collections, displaying videos with clear ownership is essential functionality
4. **Competitive Feature**: Without this, users would need to manually upload videos separately, reducing the value of Facebook integration

## Screen Recording Notes

For your screen recording, demonstrate:
1. User logging in with Facebook and granting user_videos permission
2. Showing videos from Facebook appearing in the user's vehicle profile
3. Clear ownership - user sees their own videos in their collection
4. User can disconnect Facebook and videos are removed
5. Videos are only shown in the user's own profiles, not shared publicly

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- This is a SOCIAL APP (vehicle profiles = social profiles)
- Videos are displayed WITH OWNERS (user's own videos in their own profiles)
- Analytics are AGGREGATED & ANONYMIZED
- Users have FULL CONTROL
- Aligns with Facebook's allowed usage for social apps
