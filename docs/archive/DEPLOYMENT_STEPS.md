---

## ðŸš€ Deployment Stages

### Stage 1: Database Migration (10-15 minutes)

**Command:**
```bash
cd /Users/skylar/nuke
supabase db push
```

**What This Does:**
- Creates 14 new tables
- Creates 3 materialized views
- Adds all indexes for performance
- Enables Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Sets up data constraints

**Verification:**
```bash
# Verify tables were created
supabase db list-tables

# Check for:
âœ“ vehicle_offerings
âœ“ market_orders
âœ“ market_trades
âœ“ share_holdings
âœ“ leaderboard_snapshots
âœ“ And 9 more tables
```

### Stage 2: Frontend Build (2-3 minutes)

**Command:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**What This Does:**
- Compiles TypeScript
- Bundles React components
- Optimizes for production
- Generates source maps for debugging

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ“ 0 TypeScript errors
âœ“ Build complete
```

### Stage 3: Deploy to Production (5-10 minutes)

**Command (for Vercel):**
```bash
npm run deploy
# OR manually trigger in Vercel dashboard
```

**Command (for Docker/Other):**
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t nuke-auction-market .

# Push to registry
docker push your-registry/nuke-auction-market

# Deploy container
# (Your deployment process)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test the deployed URL
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health

# Expected: { "status": "ok" }
```

### Stage 4: Smoke Testing (10-15 minutes)

**Test Trading Flow:**
```javascript
// 1. Navigate to a vehicle page
// 2. Click trading tab
// 3. Try placing a buy order
// 4. Verify order appears in order book
// 5. Verify portfolio updates
```

**Test API Endpoints (if added):**
```bash
# Place order
curl -X POST https://your-app/api/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"offering_id":"...", "order_type":"buy", "shares":5, "price":110}'

# Get leaderboard
curl https://your-app/api/leaderboard

# Get portfolio
curl https://your-app/api/portfolio/:user_id
```

### Stage 5: Load Testing (20-30 minutes)

**Test with Concurrent Users:**
```bash
# Install k6
brew install k6

# Run load test script
k6 run load-test.js --vus 100 --duration 5m
```

**Expected Results:**
- Order matching: < 100ms
- Order book: < 50ms
- Portfolio: < 100ms
- P95 latency: < 200ms
- Error rate: < 0.1%

## ðŸ”„ Deployment Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

### Rollback Steps

**1. Immediate (within 5 minutes):**
```bash
# Roll back code to previous version
git revert HEAD --no-edit
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

**2. Database Issues (within 15 minutes):**

## ðŸ“Š Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**Availability:**
- âœ“ API response time
- âœ“ Database query time
- âœ“ WebSocket connection status
- âœ“ Error rates

**Performance:**
- âœ“ Order matching latency (target: < 100ms)
- âœ“ Order book fetch (target: < 50ms)
- âœ“ Portfolio updates (target: < 100ms)
- âœ“ Leaderboard refresh (target: < 500ms)

**Business Metrics:**
- âœ“ Number of active traders
- âœ“ Trading volume (orders/minute)
- âœ“ Commission revenue
- âœ“ Average order value

### Monitoring Tools

```bash
# View logs (if using Supabase)
supabase logs prod --follow

# Check database performance
supabase monitoring pg-stat-statements

# Monitor API (if using Vercel)
# â†’ Vercel Dashboard â†’ Analytics
```

## ðŸ“ž Troubleshooting

### Database Migration Fails

**Error:** `Failed to create table market_orders`

**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase project is active
2. Verify schema doesn't already exist:
   ```bash
   supabase db tables | grep market_orders
   ```
3. Drop existing tables if needed:
   ```bash
   supabase db execute "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS market_orders CASCADE;"
   ```
4. Re-run migration

### Build Fails

**Error:** `TypeScript compilation error`

**Solution:**
1. Run local type checking:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
2. Fix errors listed
3. Re-run build

### Order Matching Not Working

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check database migration completed
2. Verify market_orders table has data
3. Check auctionMarketEngine.ts logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f .logs/auction-engine.log
   ```
4. Test directly:
   ```javascript
   import { AuctionMarketEngine } from './services/auctionMarketEngine';
   AuctionMarketEngine.placeOrder(...);
   ```

### WebSocket Not Updating UI

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check Supabase real-time enabled:
   ```bash
   supabase status | grep "realtime"
   ```
2. Verify subscriptions in component:
   ```javascript
   console.log('WebSocket connected:', supabase.subscription)
   ```
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify RLS policies allow access

## ðŸ“ˆ Scale-Out Plan (If Needed)

When traffic increases:

### Phase 1: Database Optimization (10-100k users)
- [ ] Add read replicas for leaderboard queries
- [ ] Increase materialized view refresh frequency
- [ ] Add query result caching

### Phase 2: Distributed Architecture (100k-1M users)
- [ ] Split reads/writes across databases
- [ ] Add Redis cache layer
- [ ] Implement database sharding by offering_id

### Phase 3: Real-Time Infrastructure (1M+ users)
- [ ] Move from Supabase real-time to dedicated service
- [ ] Implement order matching on Edge
- [ ] Add CDN for static assets
