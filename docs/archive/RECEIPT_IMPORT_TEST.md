# Testing Receipt Import with Tracking

## ✅ System Ready

The receipt tracking system is now live and ready to test!

## 🧪 Test Steps

1. **Open the site**: http://localhost:5174

2. **Navigate to your profile** (make sure you're logged in as skylar@nukemannerheim.com)

3. **Go to Professional Toolbox section**

4. **Click "Import Tool Receipt"**

5. **Upload the PDF**:
   - File: `/Users/skylar/Downloads/snap on jpg/Transaction History2.pdf`
   - The system will now:
     - ✅ Create database record immediately
     - ✅ Upload PDF to storage
     - ✅ Calculate SHA-256 hash
     - ✅ Track processing status
     - ✅ Parse the receipt
     - ✅ Save all tools with receipt_document_id link

6. **Check the console** for detailed logging:
   - "Tracking receipt upload..."
   - "Receipt tracked with ID: [uuid]"
   - "Parsing receipt text..."
   - "Saving X tools to database..."
   - "Receipt status updated"

## 🔍 Verify in Database

After import, check the database:

```sql
-- See the receipt record
SELECT 
    id,
    original_filename,
    supplier_name,
    processing_status,
    tools_extracted,
    tools_saved,
    created_at
FROM tool_receipt_documents
WHERE user_id = '13450c45-3e8b-4124-9f5b-5c512094ff04'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- See the tools linked to the receipt
SELECT 
    name,
    part_number,
    purchase_price,
    receipt_document_id
FROM user_tools
WHERE user_id = '13450c45-3e8b-4124-9f5b-5c512094ff04'
AND receipt_document_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Get processing stats
SELECT * FROM get_receipt_processing_stats('13450c45-3e8b-4124-9f5b-5c512094ff04');
```

## 📊 What Changed

### Before:
- ❌ PDF uploaded → No database record
- ❌ Tools displayed → Not saved to database
- ❌ No way to track what was uploaded

### After:
- ✅ PDF uploaded → Database record created immediately
- ✅ File stored in Supabase storage
- ✅ Processing status tracked (pending → processing → completed/failed)
- ✅ All tools linked to source receipt
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Duplicate detection via file hash
- ✅ Error tracking

## 🐛 Debugging

If something goes wrong, check browser console for:
- Storage upload errors
- Database insert errors
- Parsing errors
- Status update errors

All errors are logged and tracked in the `processing_errors` JSONB field.

## 🎯 Expected Result

After successful import, you should see:
1. **Receipt record** in `tool_receipt_documents` table
2. **PDF file** in Supabase storage at `{user_id}/receipts/{timestamp}_{filename}`
3. **All tools** in `user_tools` table with `receipt_document_id` populated
4. **Processing status** = 'completed'
5. **Tools extracted** = **Tools saved** (should match)

## 📝 Notes

- The parser is using the improved SnapOnParser that handles columnar PDF extraction
- Duplicate uploads are prevented by SHA-256 file hash
- Receipt records are retained for 7 years for audit compliance
- All tools maintain a link back to their source receipt document
