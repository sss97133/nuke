# Schema Cache Fix - EXECUTED ‚úÖ

## Issue
Mobile add vehicle was failing with:
```
Failed to create vehicle: Could not find the 'created_by' column of 'vehicles' in the schema cache
```

## Root Cause
PostgREST (Supabase's API layer) had a stale schema cache that incorrectly thought there was a `created_by` column on the `vehicles` table.

## Fix Applied
Ran `scripts/fix-schema-cache.js` which:
1. ‚úÖ Dropped any stale views
2. ‚úÖ Refreshed PostgREST schema cache via query
3. ‚úÖ Verified vehicles table is accessible

## Results
```bash
üîß Fixing PostgREST schema cache...

1Ô∏è‚É£  Dropping stale views...
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Views may not exist (this is OK)

2Ô∏è‚É£  Reloading PostgREST schema cache...
   ‚úÖ Schema cache refreshed via query

3Ô∏è‚É£  Verifying vehicles table columns...
   ‚úÖ Vehicles table accessible

‚úÖ Schema cache fix complete!
```

## Status
**READY TO TEST** - Mobile add vehicle should now work!

The PostgREST schema cache has been refreshed and should no longer reference the non-existent `created_by` column.

---

## What the vehicles table actually uses:
- `user_id` - Primary owner
- `uploaded_by` - Who created the record  
- `discovered_by` - Who discovered the vehicle

**NOT `created_by`** ‚ùå
