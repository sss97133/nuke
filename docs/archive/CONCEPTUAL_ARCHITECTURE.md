# Nuke Platform: Conceptual Architecture

## 🎯 CORE PHILOSOPHY

### Platform Purpose
**Nuke is a vehicle history and ownership verification platform** that provides:
- Comprehensive vehicle documentation and timeline
- Ownership verification and relationship management
- Professional-grade vehicle assessment tools
- Data quality assurance and verification

### Design Philosophy
- **Classic Aesthetic**: Windows 95/macOS 10 visual language
- **Information Dense**: Maximum data in minimal space
- **User-Controlled**: Users edit their own data with proper authorization
- **Truth-Focused**: Real data over aesthetics, verification over convenience
