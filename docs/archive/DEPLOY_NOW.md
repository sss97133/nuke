## 📋 Pre-Flight Checklist (2 Minutes)

### Must Do Before Deploy:

1. **Update LEGAL.md** (CRITICAL)
   ```bash
   nano LEGAL.md
   # Replace these:
   # [Your Company Legal Name] → Your actual company
   # [Address] → Your address
   # [Email: legal@yourdomain.com] → Your email
   # [Your State] → Your state
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables in Vercel**
   - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
   - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - (Optional) VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY

3. **Quick Local Test**
   ```bash
   cd nuke_frontend
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:5173
   # Click Market → Should load without errors
   ```

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

These can be fixed post-launch:

1. **EditVehicle page still exists**
   - Works fine, just not using inline editing yet
   - Can merge later

2. **Some mobile/desktop components duplicated**
   - Works correctly
   - Can consolidate later

3. **No Fund UI yet**
   - Database ready
   - Can build UI in Phase 2

**None of these block launch.**

## 🆘 If Something Breaks

### Rollback Plan:

1. **Frontend Rollback (Instant)**
   ```bash
   # Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Previous → Promote
   # Or via CLI:
   vercel rollback
   ```

2. **Database Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert migrations
   supabase db reset --db-url "your-db-url"
   ```

3. **Emergency Contact**
   - Check error logs in Vercel
   - Check Supabase logs
   - Review PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
