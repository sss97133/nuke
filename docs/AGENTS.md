# Nuke Agent Architecture

## Introduction

The Nuke platform employs an intelligent agent system to automate data extraction, validation, and analysis across the interconnected ecosystem of vehicles, owners, and service providers. These agents serve as the connective tissue between various data sources, ensuring that information flows seamlessly across the platform while maintaining data integrity and providing valuable insights.

## Core Principles

Our agent architecture is built on several foundational principles:

1. **Data Interconnectedness**: All data in the system is inherently connected. A single document (like a receipt) creates relationships between multiple entities (vehicles, owners, shops, parts).

2. **Progressive Intelligence**: Agents learn and improve over time through feedback loops and observed patterns.

3. **Confidence Transparency**: All agent-extracted information includes confidence scores, allowing users to understand reliability.

4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: While agents automate many processes, humans can review, correct, and train the system.

5. **Multi-source Validation**: Information is validated against multiple trusted sources to ensure accuracy.

## Agent System Overview

The Nuke agent system is organized into specialized agents that collaborate to fulfill specific functions:

## Agent Interaction Patterns

Agents in the Nuke system collaborate through several established patterns:

### Sequential Processing

Documents typically flow through a sequence of agents:
1. Document Processing Agent extracts data
2. Data Validation Agent verifies accuracy
3. Profile Building Agent updates vehicle profiles
4. Maintenance Prediction Agent updates forecasts

### Feedback Loops

Agents provide feedback to each other to improve overall system intelligence:
- User corrections inform the Document Processing Agent about extraction errors
- Validation failures help refine extraction algorithms
- Prediction accuracy is tracked to improve future predictions

### Parallel Processing

Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different aspects of the same data:
- While one agent processes new documents, another can validate previously extracted data
- As profiles are updated, prediction models can run in parallel

## Agent Architecture

Each agent in the system follows a common architectural pattern:

### Core Components

1. **Memory System**
   - Stores past experiences and outcomes
   - Enables learning from previous operations
   - Maintains context across multiple operations

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Provides access to specialized capabilities
   - Enables interaction with external services
   - Standardizes access to shared resources

3. **Reasoning Engine**
   - Makes decisions based on available data
   - Plans sequences of operations
   - Handles uncertainty with probabilistic reasoning

4. **Execution Framework**
   - Carries out planned operations
   - Monitors progress and handles failures
   - Records outcomes for learning

### Code Structure

Agents are organized in the codebase as follows:

```
src/
  agents/
    core/
      Agent.ts               # Base agent class
      Memory.ts              # Agent memory system

    ... other agent modules
```

## Data Flow Through Agents

Here's an example of how data flows through the agent system when processing a vehicle maintenance receipt:

1. A user uploads a receipt from their vehicle's recent oil change
2. The Document Processing Agent:
   - Classifies the document as a maintenance receipt
   - Extracts shop information, service date, vehicle info, services performed
   - Structures the data according to the maintenance receipt schema

3. The Data Validation Agent:
   - Verifies the VIN matches the expected vehicle
   - Confirms the shop exists in the database or creates a new shop record
   - Validates service types against known maintenance procedures

4. The Profile Building Agent:
   - Updates the vehicle's maintenance history
   - Records the current mileage as a data point
   - Updates the last service date for oil changes

5. The Maintenance Prediction Agent:
   - Recalculates the next oil change due date
   - Updates other maintenance predictions based on current mileage
   - Generates notifications for upcoming service needs

6. The History Detective Agent:
   - Incorporates the new service into the vehicle's timeline
   - Verifies consistency with previous maintenance records
   - Identifies any gaps in service history

## Integrating with External Systems

Nuke agents integrate with various external systems to enhance their capabilities:

1. **Google Drive Integration**
   - Access to user-stored documents and receipts
   - Bulk processing of historical records
   - Automatic document organization

2. **VIN Decoder Services**
   - NHTSA database for basic VIN validation
   - Commercial services for detailed vehicle specifications
   - Recall and safety information

3. **Manufacturer Databases**
   - Service interval recommendations
   - Part compatibility information
   - Technical service bulletins

4. **Market Data Sources**
   - Vehicle valuation services
   - Auction results
   - Historical price trends

## Personalizing Agents

Users can personalize how agents operate within their Nuke experience:

### Customization Options

1. **Notification Preferences**
   - Control which agent insights trigger notifications
   - Set importance thresholds for alerts
   - Define preferred notification channels

2. **Privacy Controls**
   - Determine which data sources agents can access
   - Control what information is shared with external services
   - Set data retention policies for agent memory

3. **Automation Levels**
   - Choose between automatic updates or manual review
   - Set confidence thresholds for automatic actions
   - Define approval workflows for significant changes

4. **Specialized Focus**
   - Emphasize certain aspects of vehicle management (maintenance, investment, history)
   - Configure agents to prioritize specific data types
   - Create custom agent workflows for specific use cases

### Implementation Example

Users can customize agent behavior through a settings interface:

```typescript
// Example of user agent preferences
interface AgentPreferences {
  automationLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  confidenceThreshold: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
  notificationChannels: ('email' | 'push' | 'in-app')[];
  focus: {
    maintenance: 1-10;
    investment: 1-10;
    history: 1-10;
  };
  privacySettings: {
    allowExternalLookup: boolean;
    shareWithManufacturers: boolean;
    dataRetentionPeriod: number; // days
  };
}
```

## Best Practices for Agent Development

When extending or modifying the agent system, follow these guidelines:

1. **Maintain Agent Independence**
   - Agents should be loosely coupled, communicating through well-defined interfaces
   - Each agent should have a single, clear responsibility

2. **Prioritize Explainability**
   - Agent decisions should be traceable and explainable
   - Confidence scores should accompany all agent outputs

3. **Design for Feedback**
   - Every agent action should accommodate user feedback
   - Learning mechanisms should incorporate this feedback

4. **Handle Uncertainty Gracefully**
   - Agents should explicitly represent and reason about uncertainty
   - When confidence is low, agents should defer to human judgment

5. **Optimize for Data Connectivity**
   - Always consider how data entities relate to each other
   - Design agents to strengthen connections between data points

## Conclusion

The Nuke agent system transforms how vehicle data is processed, validated, and analyzed. By connecting disparate data points and applying intelligent analysis, these agents create a comprehensive understanding of each vehicle's history, condition, and value.

The architecture is designed to scale with the platform's growth, accommodate new data sources, and continuously improve through learning. As the agent ecosystem evolves, it will deliver increasingly sophisticated insights while maintaining the core principle that all data is connected.
