# YONO — You Only Nuke Once

**Idea:** Our proprietary moat. You do the heavy lift once; Nuke handles the rest.

---

## What "once" means (to define together)

- **One import** — Ingest a vehicle or batch once; we normalize, dedupe, and keep it current.
- **One profile** — One source of truth per vehicle; we sync listings, prices, and history.
- **One workflow** — Add/edit/list/sell in one place; we handle the rest (listings, docs, financials).

Or a combination. This doc is a placeholder: we’ll tighten the definition and then build the first slice (one flow or one place in the app where YONO is obvious).

## First slice (to define)

- **Who it’s for:** e.g. dealers, collectors, flippers.
- **One flow to show YONO:** e.g. “Add vehicle once” → we handle listing, pricing, history.
- **Where it appears:** e.g. landing, dashboard headline, or a dedicated “YONO” step in add-vehicle or import.

## Next steps

1. Align on the one sentence for YONO (e.g. “You add it once; we keep it right everywhere.”).
2. Pick one flow or one screen to make YONO visible.
3. Add copy and/or a small UI moment (headline, badge, or one screen) that says YONO.

No code here yet — spec and positioning first, then we build.
