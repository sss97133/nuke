# Design Implementation Roadmap
## Collaborative Approach for Technical and Design Teams

---

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Design System Updates (1-2 Weeks)

- Update component library to support **dynamic density settings** (compact/normal/spacious)
- Create new components for **confidence indicators** on vehicle data
- Design **timeline visualization components** for vehicle lifecycle events
- Implement **adaptive card layouts** that can reorganize based on usage patterns

### 2. Supabase Schema Implementation (1-2 Weeks)

- Execute the schema SQL on development instance
- Test with real vehicle data samples
- Verify RLS policies for correct permissioning
- Implement the data collection framework interfaces

### 3. Cross-Team Workshop (2 Days)

- Present vehicle-centric architecture to design and corporate teams
- Map user journeys to data collection touchpoints
- Identify UI components that need adaptivity
- Define success metrics for the adaptive system

---

## Short-Term Deliverables (30 Days)

### Technical Team

- Complete data normalization pipeline for integrating multiple sources
- Implement confidence scoring algorithm for conflicting data
- Create vehicle timeline aggregation service
- Deploy API endpoints for data collection from various sources

### Design Team

- Prototype adaptive dashboard layouts
- Create visual system for data confidence indicators
- Design user preference management screens
- Establish component variations for different density settings

### Product Team

- Define metrics for measuring system effectiveness
- Create user stories for key data collection scenarios
- Prioritize initial external data sources for integration
- Document API requirements for vehicle data aggregation

## Testing Strategy

### User Testing Focus Areas

1. **Usability of adaptive interfaces**
   - Can users locate frequently-used features more easily over time?
   - Do adaptive changes improve task completion rates?

2. **Data confidence visualization**
   - Do users understand the varying levels of certainty?
   - Can users effectively compare conflicting information?

3. **Timeline comprehension**
   - Can users understand the vehicle's history from multiple sources?
   - Is the chronology clear when events overlap?

### Technical Testing Requirements

1. **Data normalization accuracy**
   - Validate that different input formats are correctly standardized
   - Test conflict resolution with artificially conflicting sources

2. **Performance benchmarks**
   - Rendering time for complex vehicle timelines
   - Response time for adaptive UI changes
   - Database query optimization for common access patterns

---

## Design System Expansion

### New Component Categories

1. **Data Confidence Components**
   - Confidence badges for data points
   - Source attribution indicators
   - Verification status markers
   - Conflicting data resolution interfaces

2. **Timeline Visualization Components**
   - Chronological event streams
   - Event grouping mechanisms
   - Filter controls for timeline views
   - Source-specific styling

3. **Adaptive Layout Components**
   - Usage-based prioritization containers
   - Feature prominence adjusters
   - Context-aware information density controls
   - User preference override controls
