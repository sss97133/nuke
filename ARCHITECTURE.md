# Nuke Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

Nuke is a revolutionary platform that creates digital identities for vehicles while enabling new forms of ownership, investment, and data validation. The system is designed with a modular architecture that integrates blockchain technology, IoT data collection, and traditional vehicle management systems.

## Core Concept

At its heart, Nuke treats vehicles as first-class digital entities:
- Each vehicle has its own comprehensive digital profile
- Multiple data sources validate the vehicle's history and condition
- Economic models allow for fractional ownership and investment
- Authentication systems validate industry professionals and their work
