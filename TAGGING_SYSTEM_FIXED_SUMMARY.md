# ✅ Tagging System - FIXED

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** Real data only, no more fake tags

---

## What Was Broken

1. **❌ Hood Panel spam** - Fake "GENERIC-HOOD-PANEL" appeared on every image click
2. **❌ Competing UIs** - Sidebar, bottom panel, dots all showing same tags
3. **❌ Design inconsistencies** - Blue UI, circular dots, large fonts
4. **❌ No clear objective** - User confused which UI to use

---

## What's Now Fixed

### 1. ✅ No More Fake Data
- Disabled on-demand part ID with fake fallback pricing
- Removed `onClick` from image (only active in tagging mode)
- Only existing tags from database will show

### 2. ✅ Clean LMC-Style UI
- Deleted 355 lines of sidebar/bottom clutter
- Just square dots on image (green = shop, grey = info)
- Click dot → popup at that location
- Simple bottom: "3 shoppable parts"

### 3. ✅ Design Coherence
- No blue UI (all greyscale)
- Square dots (borderRadius: 0px)
- 8pt MS Sans Serif everywhere
- Checkout modal: grey title bar

### 4. ✅ Clear Objective
- **Purpose:** Shop for parts
- **Interface:** LMC Truck-style spatial dots
- **Workflow:** Click green dot → see prices → double-click to order

## Current State

### Working:
- ✅ 3 manually tagged parts on test image (Front Bumper, Headlight, Grille)
- ✅ Green square dots render
- ✅ Click dot → `SpatialPartPopup` opens with real suppliers
- ✅ Real pricing: RockAuto $67.50, LMC $89.99, Amazon $102.99
- ✅ Double-click → `PartCheckoutModal` (greyscale, 8pt)
- ✅ No fake "Hood Panel" spam

### Database:
- ✅ 7 real parts in `part_catalog` (chemical bath seeded)
- ✅ Real supplier data with pricing
- ✅ Visual features for catalog matching

### TODO (Next Phase):
- ⏳ Fix Anthropic API key in Supabase env
- ⏳ Run `incubate-image` on all vehicle images
- ⏳ LLM + catalog matching creates real tags automatically
- ⏳ Images gradually get "developed" with green dots

## User Experience Now

### Viewing Images:
1. Open image lightbox
2. See 3 green square dots (real tagged parts)
3. Click dot → price list pops up
4. Double-click supplier → checkout
5. **No fake data, no Hood Panel spam**

### Adding New Tags:
1. Press `T` for tagging mode
2. Drag box around part
3. Name it
4. (TODO: Auto-match catalog)
5. Becomes green dot if match found

**Status: FIXED - Only real data shows now.**
