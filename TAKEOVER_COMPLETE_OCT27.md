## 💡 HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

### **Transaction Lifecycle:**

```mermaid
1. Buyer clicks "Buy Vehicle" on vehicle page
   ↓
2. Buyer enters phone number
   ↓
3. create-vehicle-transaction-checkout creates Stripe session
   ↓
4. Buyer pays 2% facilitation fee via Stripe
   ↓
5. stripe-webhook receives payment confirmation
   ↓
6. generate-transaction-documents creates legal docs
   ↓
7. send-transaction-sms sends signing links to both parties
   ↓
8. Both parties sign documents via /sign/:token
   ↓
9. When both signed: send-transaction-sms sends completion SMS
   ↓
10. create-shipping-listing auto-creates Central Dispatch listing (if connected)
```

### **Data Flow:**

**Tables:**
- `vehicle_transactions` - Main transaction record
- `transaction_notifications` - SMS log
- `shipping_events` - Central Dispatch updates
- `platform_integrations` - Connection status

**Edge Functions:**
- Input: User actions, webhooks
- Processing: Business logic, API calls
- Output: SMS, documents, database updates

⚠️ **Document Generation** - Templates created but not generated with real data

### **Pending:**
⏳ **Central Dispatch Integration** - Awaiting credentials (3 business days)
⏳ **Stripe Webhook** - May need configuration in Stripe dashboard
⏳ **Production Phone Numbers** - May need Twilio verification

## 📞 RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### **Priority 1: Configure Stripe Webhook**
```bash
# In Stripe Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Developers > Webhooks
# 2. Add endpoint: https://qkgaybvrernstplzjaam.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
# 3. Select event: checkout.session.completed
# 4. Copy webhook signing secret
# 5. Verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches in Supabase
```

### **Priority 2: Test Transaction Flow**
```bash
# 1. Create a test vehicle listing:
   - Mark as "For Sale"
   - Set asking price: $15,000
   
# 2. Test as buyer (different account):
   - Click "Buy This Vehicle"
   - Enter phone: YOUR_REAL_PHONE
   - Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - Verify SMS received
   
# 3. Monitor logs:
   supabase functions logs --follow
   
# 4. Check database:
   SELECT * FROM vehicle_transactions;
   SELECT * FROM transaction_notifications;
```

### **Priority 3: Verify Twilio SMS**
```bash
# Send test SMS to verify Twilio is working:
# Use Supabase SQL Editor:

SELECT send_transaction_sms(
  '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',  -- dummy transaction_id
  'sign_request',                            -- notification_type
  'buyer'                                     -- recipient_type
);

# Check if SMS delivered to your number
```
