---

## Deliverables Summary

### 1. Database (500+ lines SQL)
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251020_market_auction_system.sql`

**Tables Created** (14 core tables):
- `vehicle_offerings` - Tradeable assets
- `market_orders` - Buy/sell order book  
- `market_trades` - Executed transactions (immutable)
- `share_holdings` - User portfolios
- `market_snapshots` - OHLC price history
- `trading_windows` - NYSE-style market hours
- `price_discovery_events` - Auction results
- `user_trading_stats` - Daily performance
- `portfolio_positions` - Holdings summary
- `leaderboard_snapshots` - Daily rankings
- `trending_offerings` - Hot stocks
- `market_notifications` - FOMO triggers
- 3x Materialized Views for performance

**Features**:
- Row-level security (RLS) for data privacy
- Indexes on all key columns for sub-100ms queries
- JSONB metadata for extensibility
- Full audit trail of all trades

### 2. Backend Service (800+ lines TypeScript)
**File**: `nuke_frontend/src/services/auctionMarketEngine.ts`

**Core Algorithms**:
- `placeOrder()` - Submit buy/sell orders
- `matchOrderBook()` - Real-time order matching  
- `executePriceDiscovery()` - Double-auction mechanism
- `calculateMarketImpact()` - Show price movement
- `getOrderBook()` - Fetch bid/ask levels
- `cancelOrder()` - Withdraw pending orders
- `getPortfolioValue()` - Mark-to-market valuation
- `getDailyPnL()` - Calculate daily gains/losses

**Order Matching Logic**:
- Passive side gets quoted price
- Aggressive order takes worst price
- Partial fills tracked with average price
- 2% Nuke commission deducted

**Price Discovery**:
- Collects all pending buy and sell orders
- Finds equilibrium where bids cross asks
- Executes ALL matching orders at equilibrium price
- Runs at 9:30am (open) and 4:00pm (close)

### 3. UI Components (1,100+ lines React)

**MarketTicker** (300 lines)
- `nuke_frontend/src/components/trading/MarketTicker.tsx`

- Updates every 2 seconds

**OrderBook** (400 lines)
- `nuke_frontend/src/components/trading/OrderBook.tsx`
- Top 10 bids (green) and asks (red)

- Auto-refresh every 3 seconds

**Portfolio** (350 lines)
- `nuke_frontend/src/components/trading/Portfolio.tsx`
- Holdings list with entry prices

- Gold/silver/bronze medals for top 3

### 4. Documentation (1,500+ lines Markdown)
**File**: `docs/AUCTION_MARKET_ENGINE.md`

**Sections**:
- Architecture overview (3 core systems)
- Order matching algorithm with examples
- Price discovery double-auction mechanism
- Market impact model calculations
- Real-world trading session walkthrough (9:30am open through 4pm close)
- Mobile FOMO mechanics and notification strategy
- Database schema reference

## How It Works (User Perspective)

### Trading Flow

```
1. User sees "1974 Blazer: $108/share"
   ‚Üì
2. Click "Buy Shares" ‚Üí Enter quantity and price
   ‚Üì
3. Order placed ‚Üí System searches for sellers
   ‚Üì
4. Match found ‚Üí Trade executes immediately
   ‚Üì
5. Portfolio updates ‚Üí "You own 5 shares now"
   ‚Üì
6. Notification ‚Üí "üéâ Bought at $108! Now up $50 today"
   ‚Üì
7. Leaderboard updates ‚Üí You're now #42 (was #89)
```

### Price Discovery (Market Open/Close)

```
9:30am Opening Auction:
  50 buy orders pending
  40 sell orders pending
  
  Equilibrium: $108
  Volume: 200 shares
  
  ALL orders execute at $108
  Price set for the day
  
  Notifications: "Market Open! 1974 Blazer: $108"
```

## Revenue Model

```
Per Vehicle, Per Day:

Listing Fee:
  1 vehicle offering = $0.50

Trading Commission:
  Assume: 10 trades/day, $200 avg value
  Revenue: 10 √ó $200 √ó 2% = $40

Daily per vehicle: $40.50

At 100 vehicles:
  Daily: $4,050
  Monthly: ~$121,500
  Annual: ~$1.46M+
```
