# N-Zero | YC Pitch

## One-Liner (50 chars)

**We ingest and normalize vehicle data at scale.**

---

## Tagline

**The living VIN for every build.**

---

## The Pitch

Every car has a VIN that tells where it came from.
We're building the platform that tells where it's been and why it matters.

---

## Problem

A car's history after the factory is scattered:
- Receipts in shoeboxes
- Forum posts from 2008
- Auction comments
- Instagram stories
- Garage invoices

Buyers can't verify claims. Collectors can't prove value. Insurers can't assess risk.

**The VIN tells you where a car started. Nothing tells you where it's been.**

---

## Solution

N-Zero creates a **living digital lineage** for vehicles:

1. **Autonomous extraction** from auctions, forums, and marketplaces
2. **AI-powered analysis** of comments, descriptions, and images
3. **Verified timelines** that owners and shops contribute to
4. **Provenance reports** for buyers, insurers, and auction houses
