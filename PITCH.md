# YC Pitch

## One-Liner

**Vehicle data infrastructure.**

---

## The Pitch

We turn scattered car history into structured, tradable intelligence.

---

## Problem

A car's history after the factory is scattered:
- Receipts in shoeboxes
- Forum posts from 2008
- Auction comments
- Instagram stories

Buyers can't verify claims. Collectors can't prove value. Insurers can't assess risk.

---

## Solution

- Aggregate vehicle history from auctions, forums, marketplaces
- Structure provenance into verified timelines
- Connect owners, shops, buyers, insurers around shared records

---

## Traction

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Vehicle profiles | 18,000+ |
| Data points indexed | 364,000+ |
| Images | 1,000,000+ |
| Platform integrations | BaT, Cars & Bids, Hagerty, RM Sotheby's |

---

## Business Model

- SaaS for builders and shops
- Marketplace fees
- Premium reports for buyers, insurers, auctions

---

## Vision

Provenance infrastructure for automobiles.

Chrono24 for watches. Artsy for art. **This for cars.**
