# YC Pitch

## One-Liner (50 chars)

**We ingest and normalize vehicle data at scale.**

---

## The Pitch

Vehicle data infrastructure. We turn scattered car history into structured, tradable intelligence.

---

## Problem

A car's history after the factory is scattered:
- Receipts in shoeboxes
- Forum posts from 2008
- Auction comments
- Instagram stories
- Garage invoices

Buyers can't verify claims. Collectors can't prove value. Insurers can't assess risk.

---

## Solution

- **Autonomous extraction** from auctions, forums, and marketplaces
- **AI-powered analysis** of comments, descriptions, and images
- **Verified timelines** that owners and shops contribute to
- **Provenance reports** for buyers, insurers, and auction houses

---

## Traction

| Metric | Count |
