## 🎯 WHAT'S WORKING

### User Flow (Anonymous)

2. ✅ Sees MobileTradingPanel with "Sign in to trade" prompt
3. ✅ Click redirects to login

### User Flow (Authenticated)
1. ✅ User visits vehicle profile
2. ✅ Sees real cash balance and share holdings
3. ✅ Can input shares and price
4. ✅ Sees real-time order cost with 2% commission
5. ✅ Click "BUY/SELL" opens OrderConfirmationModal
6. ✅ Modal shows 6-point risk disclosure
7. ✅ Requires terms acceptance checkbox
8. ✅ On confirm, calls place-market-order Edge Function
9. ✅ Edge Function validates funds/shares
10. ✅ Edge Function reserves cash (for buy orders)

12. ✅ UI refreshes balances after successful order

### Security

## ⚠️ REMAINING WORK (Future Enhancements)

### Critical for Live Trading
1. **Order Matching Engine** - Background job to match buy/sell orders
   - Match orders by price-time priority
   - Execute trades and update holdings
   - Release reserved funds on fill

2. **Share Reservation** - Prevent selling same shares multiple times
   - Add `reserve_shares()` SQL function
   - Lock shares when sell order is placed
   - Release on cancel/fill

3. **Vehicle Offering Creation** - UI/flow to create offerings
   - Admin/owner can list vehicle for trading
   - Set initial share price, total shares
   - Create offering_id for vehicle

4. **Initial Deposits** - Users need cash to trade
   - Stripe integration for deposits
   - ACH/wire transfer processing
   - Withdrawal flow

### Nice-to-Have
