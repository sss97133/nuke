## 🎯 Key Technical Achievements

### **1. Automotive-Specific Accounting**
Solved the fundamental challenge: "Car business expenses don't fit standard accounting"

```
STANDARD ACCOUNTING:
❌ Parts = immediate expense
❌ Labor = simple payroll
❌ Tools = annual depreciation

AUTOMOTIVE ACCOUNTING (What you built):
✅ Parts = asset (inventory) → COGS when installed
✅ Labor = split (direct COGS vs indirect expense)
✅ Tools = per-use depreciation
✅ Multiple revenue streams properly categorized
✅ Work-in-progress tracking
✅ Exports to standard accounting software
```

### **2. Modular Integration Architecture**
Works with any user's existing system:

```
NUKE PLATFORM
    ↓ (tracks automotive-specific data)
TRANSLATION LAYER
    ↓ (converts to GAAP-compliant entries)
USER'S SYSTEM
    ├─ QuickBooks (API ready)
    ├─ Xero (API ready)
    ├─ PennyLane (API ready)
    └─ CSV (working now!) → Any software
```

### **3. Privacy-First Design**
```
Client privacy levels work everywhere:
├─ Timeline modal: "John █████"
├─ Invoice list: "John █████"
├─ Receipt HTML: "John Smith" or masked
├─ Financial reports: Respects privacy
└─ Exports: Can mask or include based on settings
```

### **4. Contract-Driven Pricing**
```
Rate hierarchy enforced automatically:
1. Contract: $65/hr (client-specific deal)
2. User: $75/hr (tech skill-based)
3. Shop: $85/hr (business default)
4. System: $50/hr (fallback)

Applied in:
├─ TCI calculation
├─ Invoice generation
├─ Financial reports
└─ Journal entries
```
