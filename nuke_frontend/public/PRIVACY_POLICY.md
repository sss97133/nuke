# Privacy Policy — N-Zero Platform

Last updated: November 7, 2025

### 1. Who we are
N-Zero ("Nuke", "we", "our") operates the vehicle portfolio and marketplace application available at n-zero.dev. We build software that lets organizations document vehicles, manage inventories, and publish listings to partner marketplaces.

### 2. Information we collect
- **Account data** – name, email address, authentication identifiers, organization membership, and role metadata.
- **Vehicle & media uploads** – photos, videos, documents, notes, geo metadata, and timeline events that you add to an organization or vehicle profile.
- **Commerce details** – business compliance information, catalog identifiers, pricing, and order fulfillment data required for partner marketplaces.
- **Usage diagnostics** – log entries, device/browser identifiers, and aggregated analytics used to keep the platform secure and improve performance.

### 3. How we use information
- Provide and secure the N-Zero platform, including user authentication, audit trails, and role-based access.
- Power inventory management, vehicle documentation, marketplace listings, and compliance workflows.
- Detect fraud, resolve support requests, and satisfy legal/regulatory requirements.
- Maintain backups, disaster recovery copies, and product analytics.

### 4. Sharing & third parties
We never sell personal information. We share data only with:
- Infrastructure providers (Supabase, Vercel, AWS) that host the platform.
- Payment and marketplace partners (e.g., Meta Commerce) when an organization explicitly connects their accounts.
- Service vendors that process analytics, support tickets, or compliance documents under data processing agreements.
All third parties are bound by confidentiality and security obligations consistent with this policy.

### 5. Data retention
Operational data is retained for the life of an organization account. Backups and audit logs may be stored for up to seven (7) years to satisfy financial and regulatory requirements. You may request data deletion at any time as described below.

### 6. Security
We encrypt data in transit and at rest, enforce least-privilege access, and review security controls regularly. Access to production systems is restricted to approved personnel with MFA.

### 7. Your rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your personal data. Submit requests via privacy@n-zero.dev and we will respond within 30 days.

### 8. Data deletion requests
Email privacy@n-zero.dev from the address associated with your account. We verify ownership, disable access, remove profile data, scrub organization-specific contributions (unless an organization requires ongoing retention for compliance), and confirm when deletion is complete.

### 9. Contact
- **Email:** privacy@n-zero.dev
