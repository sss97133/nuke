# Data Deletion Instructions — N-Zero Platform

We respect your right to delete personal information associated with n-zero.dev. Follow the steps below to request deletion.

### 1. Email request
Send an email to **privacy@n-zero.dev** from the email address associated with your N-Zero account. Use the subject line “Data Deletion Request – N-Zero”. Include:
- Your full name
- Organization(s) you belong to (if any)
- Whether you want to delete just your user profile or all organization records you own

### 2. Identity verification
We verify each request to protect your data. You may be asked to reply from the same email address, confirm the last login date, or provide additional organization details.

### 3. Processing timeline
Once verified, we:
- Disable and sign out your account.
- Remove profile details, authentication links, and personal activity logs.
- Delete or anonymize contributions associated only with you (vehicle notes, uploads, timeline events) unless an organization is legally required to retain them. Organization owners receive notice when shared assets are affected.
- Remove integrations (e.g., Facebook Marketplace tokens) linked to your user ID.

You will receive confirmation once deletion is complete, typically within 7 business days. Backups and audit trails may persist for up to seven (7) years to satisfy legal obligations, after which they are permanently destroyed.

### 4. Organization-wide deletion
If you are the verified owner of an organization and want the entire workspace removed, state that explicitly in your email. We will coordinate with other contributors, cancel active marketplace listings, and permanently delete business records after the required notice period.
