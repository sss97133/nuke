# Nuke Frontend Application

React/TypeScript frontend for the Nuke vehicle identity management platform.

## Overview

The frontend application provides a comprehensive user interface for vehicle lifecycle management, timeline tracking, and professional verification workflows. Built with modern React patterns and optimized for performance at scale.

## Technical Stack

- **React 18+** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Supabase** for authentication and real-time features
- **Custom component library** with modular architecture

## Architecture

### Component Structure
