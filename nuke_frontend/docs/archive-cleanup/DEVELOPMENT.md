# Development Guide

## Automated Import/Export Fixing

After major refactoring work, you may encounter import/export issues. This project includes automated tools to detect and fix common problems.

### Quick Fix Process

1. **Run the automated fixer:**
   ```bash
   npm run fix-imports
   ```

2. **Check TypeScript compilation:**
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

3. **Start/restart development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### What the Automated Fixer Does

- ✅ Clears Vite cache to resolve stale module resolution
- ✅ Runs TypeScript compilation to detect issues
- ✅ Parses compilation errors for import/export problems
- ✅ Automatically adds missing exports to files
- ✅ Fixes common module resolution issues
- ✅ Reports on fixes applied

### Common Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Default Exports**: Automatically adds `export default` statements
2. **Missing Named Exports**: Adds `export` keyword to function/class declarations
3. **Stale Module Cache**: Clears Vite cache to resolve cached import issues
4. **Type Import Issues**: Handles TypeScript import resolution problems

### Manual Fixes May Be Required For

- Complex module path resolution
- Circular dependency issues
- Third-party library import problems
- Custom webpack/vite configuration conflicts

### Architecture Benefits

This automated approach ensures:
- **Faster Development**: No manual hunting for import/export issues
- **Consistent Fixes**: Standardized approach to common problems
- **Reduced Errors**: Less chance of missing exports during refactoring
- **Time Savings**: Automated detection and fixing of routine issues
