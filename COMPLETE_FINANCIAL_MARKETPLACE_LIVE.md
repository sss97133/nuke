## Next Steps to Make It All Work

### Create Test Funding Round

Run this to create a funding round for the K5:

```sql
SELECT create_funding_round(
  'a90c008a-3379-41d8-9eb2-b4eda365d74c'::uuid,  -- K5 vehicle ID
  '0b9f107a-d124-49de-9ded-94698f63c1c4'::uuid,  -- Your user ID (builder)
  1000000,  -- $10,000 target
  25.0,     -- 25% profit share to stakers
  'K5 Blazer restoration: engine, paint, interior',
  NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days'  -- 30 day funding deadline
);
```

Then you can stake $3 on it!
