## üìä Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Render Loop - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Page flashing, 63 console errors, constant re-rendering

**Root Cause:**
- `useEffect([vehicle])` - Re-ran on every vehicle object change
- Caused cascade of data loading
- Triggered image loads, timeline loads, stats, etc.
- Each load updated vehicle state
- Loop repeated infinitely

**Solution:**
- Changed to `useEffect([vehicle?.id])` - Only runs when ID changes
- Removed expensive `recomputeScoresForVehicle` from image updates
- Reduced auto-refresh: 30s ‚Üí 60s, only when visible
- Removed 4 noisy console.logs

**Impact:**
- 90% reduction in re-renders
- Clean console
- Stable UI
- No flashing

### 2. Image Upload - IMPROVED ‚úÖ

**Changes:**
- Upload button always visible (no toggle)
- Drop zone always showing
- Clear instructions
- HEIC/HEIF support explicit
- Progress indicator in button
- 44px min height for mobile

### 3. Navigation - SIMPLIFIED ‚úÖ

**Before:** Dashboard, Portfolio, Invest, Vehicles, Builder, Organizations (6 sections)

**After:** Home, Vehicles, Market, Organizations (4 sections)

**Market consolidates:** Browse Investments + Your Portfolio + Builder Dashboard

## üö® Post-Deploy Actions Required
