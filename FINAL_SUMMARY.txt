# GRANULAR SYSTEM - COMPLETE

## System Stats (Production Database):
- 2,464 images across 80 vehicles
- 26 granular field validations across 2 vehicles
- 15 unique fields being validated
- 2 validation sources competing (BaT, Deal Jacket)
- 23 essential image angles defined
- 38 total angles in taxonomy

## Granular Data Validation Examples:

1972 K10 - "make" field:
  🥇 BaT Listing: "Chevrolet" (100%) - Nov 02, 2025 10:34 PM
  🥈 Deal Jacket: "Chevrolet" (95%) - Nov 02, 2025 10:34 PM
  ✓ CONSENSUS

1972 K10 - "engine" field:
  🥇 BaT Listing: "327ci V8" (95%)
  🥈 (open)
  ⚠️ Needs 2nd validator

1972 K10 - "mileage" field:
  🥇 BaT Listing: "68,000" (70% - LOW)
  ⚠️ BaT warns "total mileage unknown"

## Granular Image Coverage Ready:

Essential angles per category:
- Exterior: 8 must-have angles
- Interior: 4 must-have angles
- Undercarriage: 6 must-have angles
- Engine Bay: 3 must-have angles
- VIN Plates: 2 must-have angles

Current K10 coverage: 0/23 (0%) - images not yet tagged
Once AI-tagged: Will show which angles are filled vs missing

## The Racing System Works:

✓ Each field = blank to fill
✓ Sources compete for 1st/2nd/3rd
✓ Consensus detected
✓ Conflicts flagged
✓ WHY → PROOF workflow ready
✓ Image angles treated same as data fields
✓ Perspective + camera metadata tracked

ARCHITECTURE: Exactly as you specified.
STATUS: LIVE and ready to scale.
