### ✅ 2. **Enhanced Full-Screen Viewer**

  - Work order title, date, cost, duration
  - Photo position ("Photo 5/30 from work session")
  - EXIF metadata (date, camera, size)
  - Stats (views, likes, comments)
  - Gesture guide

### ✅ 4. **Gesture-Based Interactions**
- **Double-tap** → Like (heart burst animation)
- **Swipe right** → Save (star sparkle)
- **Swipe left** → Next image
- **Swipe down** → Close viewer
- **Swipe up** → Show details
- **Long-press** → Quick tag menu (placeholder)

### ✅ 5. **Visual Feedback Animations**
- Heart burst on like (❤️ expands and fades)
- Star sparkle on save (⭐ rotates and fades)
- Haptic vibration on gestures (if supported)
- Gesture hint overlay (fades after 3s)

- "YOU" badge on your uploaded photos

### ✅ 10. **Progress Context Visualization**
- Work order badge on viewer ("📅 Aug 24, 2022 • 5/30")
- Shows which work session photo belongs to
- Helps understand project timeline

### ✅ 11. **Gesture Hint Overlay**
- Auto-displays on viewer open

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ Full-res images slow to load
- ❌ Click image → direct to full-screen, no context
- ❌ No work order information
- ❌ Can't delete uploaded images
- ❌ Buttons for all interactions (clunky)
- ❌ No visual feedback
- ❌ Images not grouped by work session
- ❌ No chronological context
- ❌ Calendar extends past screen
- ❌ No way to understand project timeline

### After:
- ✅ Optimized images (400px for mobile)
- ✅ Full tooling access in viewer
- ✅ Work order context on every image
- ✅ Delete button for uploaders
- ✅ Gesture-based interactions (fast, fun)
- ✅ Heart/star animations with haptic feedback
- ✅ Timeline Photos view with work order cards
- ✅ Chronological organization by event date
- ✅ Calendar fits mobile screen
- ✅ Photo sequencing shows progress (5/30)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Gesture System
```typescript
- Double-tap detection (< 300ms between taps)
- Long-press detection (> 500ms, minimal movement)
- Swipe detection (deltaX/Y > 50px)
- Haptic feedback: navigator.vibrate()
- CSS animations: @keyframes heartBurst, starSparkle
```

### Work Order Context
```typescript
// Join timeline events with images
SELECT vi.*, te.title, te.cost_amount, te.duration_hours
FROM vehicle_images vi
LEFT JOIN timeline_events te ON vi.timeline_event_id = te.id
```

### Performance
- Medium URLs (400px) instead of full res
- Lazy loading on images
- Portal rendering for modals
- Optimized grid layouts
