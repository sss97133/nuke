## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Push Code**

- Lightbox opens (full-screen portal ✅)
- **NO dots visible** (no tags yet)
- Can manually tag (drag box, enter name)
- Grey dot appears
- Click grey dot → popup says "Part not in catalog yet"

### **Step 3: Add Test Data (Make It Work)**

#### **Option A: Manual Enrichment (Quick Test)**

1. Click image → lightbox
2. Drag box around bumper → enter "Front Bumper"
3. Grey dot appears
4. Click grey dot → popup opens

9. Click green dot → see 3 suppliers scrolling
10. Double-click LMC → checkout modal
11. ✅ **FULL FLOW WORKS**

#### **Option B: Scrape LMC Catalog (Production-Ready)**

```bash

curl -X POST "https://qkgaybvrernstplzjaam.supabase.co/functions/v1/scrape-lmc-truck" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected result:
{
  "success": true,
  "parts_scraped": 200-500,
  "categories_processed": 7,
  "message": "Scraped 500 parts from LMC Truck"
}
```

Then:
1. Click image → AI Analyze
2. AI detects: Bumper, Headlight, Grille, Wheel, etc.
3. System auto-matches against part_catalog
4. Tags appear as GREEN dots (already shoppable!)
5. Click any dot → instant price comparison
6. ✅ **ZERO MANUAL WORK**
