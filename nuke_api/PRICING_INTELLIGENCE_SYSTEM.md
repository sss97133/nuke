## 📊 How It Works

### Automated Vehicle Analysis Flow

```
1. Vehicle Created → 🎯 Hook Triggered
2. Gather Data:
   ├── 🌐 Web Scraping (AutoTrader, Cars.com, CarGurus)
   ├── 🤖 OpenAI Analysis (GPT-4 with custom prompts)
   ├── 📸 Image Analysis (existing tags + modifications)
   └── 📈 Historical Data (price trends, market cycles)

3. Apply Equation:
   ├── Market Weight (40%) × Market Data Average
   ├── AI Weight (30%) × OpenAI Estimated Value
   ├── Mod Weight (20%) × Modification Impact
   └── Condition Weight (10%) × Condition Adjustments

4. Generate Report:
   ├── 💰 Final Estimated Value
   ├── 🎯 Confidence Score (0-100%)
   ├── 📋 Value Breakdown (transparent components)
   ├── ⚠️ Risk Factors (high mileage, damage, etc.)
   ├── 📈 Market Position (excellent/good/fair/poor)
   └── 🧑‍💼 Human Review Flag (if confidence < threshold)

5. Human Interface:
   ├── ✅ Auto-approve high-confidence valuations
   ├── 🔍 Review queue for low-confidence valuations
   ├── ✏️ Override any valuation with reasoning
   └── 📊 Performance tracking and system tuning
```

### OpenAI Prompt Engineering

The system uses sophisticated prompts that combine:
- **Vehicle specifications** (year, make, model, mileage, condition)
- **Market data context** (comparable sales, price ranges, trends)
- **Modification details** (tagged parts, installation quality, brands)
- **Visual evidence** (image count, documentation quality)

Example AI analysis output:
```json
{
  "estimated_value": 35000,
  "confidence_score": 87,
  "value_drivers": [
    "Well-documented modification history",
    "Premium aftermarket parts (Borla, K&N, Eibach)",
    "Strong market demand for this model year"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Higher than average mileage",
    "Modified suspension may affect resale"
  ],
  "market_position": "good",
  "recommendations": [
    "Document installation receipts for maximum value",
    "Consider professional inspection for high-stakes sale"
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration & Control

### Equation Weights (Human Controllable)
```elixir
%{
  market_weight: 0.4,        # Trust level for scraped market data
  ai_weight: 0.3,           # Trust level for OpenAI analysis
  modification_weight: 0.2,  # Impact of tagged modifications
  condition_weight: 0.1,    # Vehicle condition factors
  human_override_weight: 1.0 # Always trust human input completely
}
```

## 💡 Philosophy: AI + Human Intelligence

This system embodies the principle that **AI should augment human intelligence, not replace it**:

- ✅ **AI handles routine analysis** - market data gathering, basic calculations
- ✅ **Humans control the equations** - weights, thresholds, overrides
- ✅ **Transparency is paramount** - every decision is explainable
- ✅ **Learning is bidirectional** - AI learns from human feedback
- ✅ **Humans focus on expertise** - edge cases, rare vehicles, nuanced decisions

The result is a system that **scales human expertise** rather than replacing it, creating **superhuman combinations** of AI speed with human judgment.
