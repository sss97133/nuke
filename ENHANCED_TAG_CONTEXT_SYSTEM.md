- `connect_tags_to_receipts()`: Links tags to matching receipts

### **3. Enhanced Tag Display**

**Lightbox Now Shows:**
```
ðŸ¤– Transfer Case NP205          [âœ“]
   Confidence: 87% â€¢ Part: NP205 â€¢ Brand: GM â€¢ Est. Cost: $800
   ðŸ“… Engine rebuild session - Day 3
   ðŸ’­ NP205 transfer case shows signs of wear on input shaft
   ðŸ§¾ Connected to receipt: CJ Pony Parts ($847.50)
   [CJ Pony Parts] [LMC Truck]
   [âœ“ Verify] [âœ— Reject]
```

**Context Fields:**
- **Work Session**: Which work session this tag belongs to
- **User Notes**: AI-generated contextual observations
- **Receipt Connection**: Linked receipt with vendor and amount
- **Estimated Cost**: AI-estimated part cost
- **Vendor Links**: Direct links to purchase parts

### **4. Tool Recognition Improvements**

**Enhanced Categories:**
- **Hand Tools**: wrenches, sockets, ratchets, pliers, screwdrivers
- **Power Tools**: drills, impacts, grinders, sanders, saws  
- **Specialty Tools**: torque wrenches, pullers, presses, meters
- **Lifting Equipment**: jacks, stands, hoists, cranes
- **Safety Equipment**: glasses, gloves, respirators, harnesses

**Tool Usage Tracking:**
- Links detected tools to user's inventory
- Tracks usage frequency across vehicles
- Calculates ROI based on usage vs cost
- Shows which tools are most/least used

### **5. Receipt Connection System**

**Automatic Matching:**
- Matches AI-detected parts to user receipts
- Uses part numbers, brand names, and descriptions
- Calculates match confidence scores
- Links cost validation to detected parts

**Cost Validation:**
- Shows actual receipt amounts vs AI estimates
- Validates part pricing accuracy
- Tracks spending patterns

## **How It Works**

### **1. Enhanced Analysis Pipeline**

                                      â†“
                              Context Gathering:
                              â€¢ Vehicle specs
                              â€¢ User receipts  
                              â€¢ Previous work
                              â€¢ Session images
                              â€¢ Tool inventory
                                      â†“
                              Enhanced Output:
                              â€¢ Specific part numbers
                              â€¢ Work session context
                              â€¢ Receipt connections
                              â€¢ Tool usage tracking
                              â€¢ Cost estimates
```

### **2. Context-Rich Tags**
Each tag now includes:
- **Work Session**: "Engine rebuild session - Day 3"
- **User Notes**: "NP205 transfer case shows signs of wear on input shaft"
- **Receipt Connection**: Links to actual purchase receipt
- **Cost Data**: Both estimated and actual costs
- **Usage Context**: How tools were used

### **3. Tool Analytics**
Track tool ROI:
- **Usage Frequency**: How often each tool is used
- **ROI Calculation**: (Hours Used Ã— $50/hr) / Tool Cost
- **Vehicle Coverage**: How many different vehicles each tool works on
- **Last Used**: When tools were last utilized

## **Benefits**

### **1. Better Context**
- Tags are no longer isolated - they're part of work sessions
- AI adds intelligent observations about what it sees
- Users understand the bigger picture of their work

### **2. Cost Validation**
- AI estimates are validated against actual receipts
- Users see real vs estimated costs
- Better understanding of build investment

### **3. Tool Intelligence**
- Track which tools get the most use
- Identify underutilized tools
- Calculate actual ROI on tool purchases
- Plan future tool investments

### **4. Work Session Organization**
- Related work is grouped intelligently
- Timeline events are more meaningful
- Progress tracking is clearer

## **Next Steps**

1. âœ… Enhanced AI Agent Supervisor created
2. âœ… Database schema updated
3. âœ… Frontend display enhanced
4. ðŸ”„ Deploy AI Agent Supervisor function
