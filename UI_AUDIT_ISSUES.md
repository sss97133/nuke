# UI Audit - Common Sense Issues

**Date**: October 21, 2025

## Issues Found & Fixed

### ‚ùå ISSUE 1: Input Placeholder Says "cents" But User Enters Dollars
**Location**: StakeOnVehicle.tsx, BondInvestment.tsx, TradePanel.tsx

**Problem**:
```tsx
<input placeholder="Custom amount (cents)" />
// User enters "3" thinking it's $3
// Actually stored as 3 cents = $0.03
```

**User Confusion**: "I entered $3 but it says $0.03?"

**Fix**: Change placeholder to "Amount in USD" or remove entirely

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE 2: No Visual Feedback After Actions
**Location**: All financial components

**Problem**:
- User stakes $3
- Alert says "Success!"
- But UI doesn't refresh
- Balance still shows old amount

**User Frustration**: "Did it work? I don't see the change"

**Fix**: Auto-reload data after successful stake/purchase

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE 3: Tab Labels Too Verbose on Mobile
**Location**: FinancialProducts.tsx

**Current**:
```
[ üí∞ Profit Stakes | üìä Trade Shares | üè¶ Bonds | üöó Buy Whole ]
Earn % of sale profit | Buy/sell anytime | Fixed interest | Own 100%
```

**On Mobile**: Text wraps, looks messy

**Fix**: Simplify to emoji + single word

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE 4: No "Loading" State
**Location**: Portfolio.tsx, FinancialProducts

**Problem**:
- Page loads
- Shows "0 transactions" immediately
- Then updates to show real data
- Feels janky

**Fix**: Show "Loading..." skeleton

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE 5: Error Messages Are Ugly Alerts
**Location**: All components use `alert()`

**Problem**:
```javascript
alert('Insufficient funds. You have $1.50, need $3.00');
```

**User Experience**: Browser alert = amateur, breaks flow

**Fix**: Use inline error messages or toast notifications

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE 6: No Confirmation for Large Stakes
**Location**: StakeOnVehicle.tsx

**Problem**:
- User enters $5,000 stake
- Clicks button
- Money immediately gone
- No "Are you sure?"

**User Panic**: "Wait, I didn't mean to do that!"

**Fix**: Confirm for amounts > $100

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE 7: Funding Round Progress Unclear
**Location**: StakeOnVehicle.tsx

**Current**:
```
Raised: $7,500
Target: $10,000
```

**Problem**: User can't quickly see "Oh, 75% funded"

**Already Fixed**: Progress bar exists ‚úÖ

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE 8: Portfolio Shows $0.00 Before Load
**Location**: Portfolio.tsx

**Problem**:
- Initial state: balance = 0
- Renders "$0.00"
- Then loads real data
- User sees flash of poverty

**Fix**: Show loading state, or null until loaded

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE 9: Transaction History Empty State Is Sad
**Location**: Portfolio.tsx

**Current**: "No transactions yet. Deposit cash to get started!"

**Problem**: Feels like scolding

**Fix**: Make it inviting: "Ready to invest? Deposit cash to begin trading."

---

### ‚ùå ISSUE 10: Bonds Show Interest in Cents
**Location**: BondInvestment.tsx

**Calculation**:
```typescript
const annualInterest = Math.floor(parseInt(amount) * bond.interest_rate_pct / 100);
```

**Problem**: If `amount = "1000"` (user thinks $10), calculation treats as 1000 cents = $10

**Actually**: This might be correct IF amount is in cents, but placeholder says USD!

**Critical Fix Needed**: Clarify if inputs are USD or cents

---

## Priority Fixes

### P0 (Critical - Breaks User Trust)

1. **Input Unit Confusion**: MUST fix placeholder text
2. **Alert Dialogs**: Replace with proper UI feedback
3. **Auto-refresh After Actions**: Currently broken

### P1 (High - Poor UX)

4. **Loading States**: Add skeleton loaders
5. **Confirmation for Large Amounts**: Prevent accidents
6. **Error Display**: Inline errors, not alerts

### P2 (Medium - Polish)

7. **Empty States**: Make them inviting
8. **Mobile Tab Labels**: Simplify
9. **Flash of Wrong Data**: Fix initial states

---

## Immediate Fixes Needed

### Fix #1: Input Placeholders (Critical)

All number inputs need clarity:

**StakeOnVehicle.tsx**:
```tsx
// WRONG:
<input placeholder="Custom amount (cents)" />

// RIGHT:
<input placeholder="Amount in USD (e.g., 3.00)" />
// AND convert: Math.floor(parseFloat(amount) * 100)
```

**Currently**: User enters "3" ‚Üí stored as 3 cents  
**Should Be**: User enters "3" ‚Üí converted to 300 cents

### Fix #2: Replace Alerts

**Current**:
```typescript
alert('Insufficient funds');
```

**Should Be**:
```typescript
setError('Insufficient funds. Available: $1.50');
// Show error in UI, not browser alert
```

### Fix #3: Auto-Refresh

**Current**:
```typescript
// After stake
alert('Success!');
// UI doesn't update
```

**Should Be**:
```typescript
// After stake
await loadData(); // Refresh balance + stakes
setSuccess('Staked $3.00 successfully!');
```

## Want Me To Fix These Now?

I can:
1. Fix input unit confusion (USD vs cents)
2. Add inline error messages
3. Add auto-refresh after actions
4. Add loading states
5. Add confirmations for large amounts
6. Polish empty states

This will make the UI actually usable instead of confusing.

Should I implement these fixes?
