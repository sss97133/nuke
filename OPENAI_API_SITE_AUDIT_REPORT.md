## API ERROR ANALYSIS

### Error Type 1: 400 Bad Request (20+ occurrences)

**Pattern**:
```
/rest/v1/vehicles?select=primary_image_url&id=eq.{vehicle_id}
```

**Cause**: Frontend queries `primary_image_url` column that doesn't exist.

**Fix Needed**:
```sql
-- Option 1: Add the column
ALTER TABLE vehicles ADD COLUMN primary_image_url TEXT;

-- Option 2: Remove query (preferred)
-- Update frontend to not query non-existent column
```

### Error Type 2: 406 Not Acceptable (5+ occurrences)

**Pattern**: RPC function calls returning 406

**Likely Causes**:
- RPC function return type mismatch
- Accept header issues
- Function not returning expected format

**Fix Needed**: Check edge function implementations
