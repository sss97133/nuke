## WHAT'S MISSING (Recommendations)

### Data Gaps Identified

1. **QuickBooks Not Connected**
   - Impact: -30 investability points
   - Action: Connect QuickBooks to Taylor Customs and Desert Performance
   - Benefit: Automated financial tracking, revenue verification

2. **Receipts/Invoices Not Captured**
   - Current: 0 vehicle_documents uploaded
   - Impact: Cannot verify parts spend, labor hours
   - Action: Upload receipts for ongoing projects
   - Benefit: Build documented project costs for ROI analysis

3. **Work Sessions Not Logged**
   - Current: 0 work sessions
   - Impact: No labor hour tracking
   - Action: Use work session feature when working on vehicles
   - Benefit: Track time investment, calculate effective hourly rate

4. **Expertise Areas Empty**
   - Current: profiles.expertise_areas = []
   - Impact: System can't match you with relevant opportunities
   - Action: Add: ['squarebody', 'body_work', 'paint', 'restoration']
   - Benefit: Get matched to relevant vehicles, forum threads

5. **Tool Inventory Not Documented**
   - Current: tool_count = 0, total_tool_value = $0
   - Impact: Can't verify shop capabilities
   - Action: Document major tools/equipment at Taylor Customs
   - Benefit: Prove capability for larger projects

6. **Business Specializations Empty**
   - Taylor Customs: specializations = []
   - Desert Performance: specializations = []
   - Action: Add ['body_work', 'paint', 'rust_repair', 'squarebody']
   - Benefit: Better org classification, investor matching
